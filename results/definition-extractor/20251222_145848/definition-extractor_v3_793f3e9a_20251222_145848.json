Let me consider whether this is truly a definition or more of a philosophical characterization/description.\n\nLet me apply the reversibility test: \"A model of reality is a picture\" - is this true? Not necessarily. There could be other models of reality besides pictures (mathematical models, physical models, etc.). So \"model of reality\" is not equivalent to \"picture\" - it's a broader category.\n\nThis seems more like a characterization or description of what pictures are (or do) rather than a strict definition. It tells us something about pictures - that they function as models of reality - but it doesn't provide the necessary and sufficient conditions for something to be a picture.\n\nA definition should work both ways: if X is defined as Y, then anything that is Y should be X. But not every model of reality is a picture.\n\nThis appears to be more of a philosophical thesis or characterization about the nature of pictures rather than a formal definition providing necessary and sufficient conditions.\n\nHowever, I need to reconsider. In the context of the Tractatus, Wittgenstein might be defining what he means by \"picture\" in his technical sense. But even so, the statement seems to describe a property of pictures rather than define the term.\n\nComparing to the examples:\n- \"A bachelor is an unmarried man\" - reversible: an unmarried man is a bachelor. Definition: yes.\n- \"A triangle is a polygon with three sides\" - reversible: a polygon with three sides is a triangle. Definition: yes.\n- \"The applied, thought, propositional sign, is the thought\" - this defines \"thought\" as the applied propositional sign.\n\nFor \"The picture is a model of reality\" - a model of reality is not necessarily a picture. This fails the reversibility test.\n\nThis seems more like a characterization or philosophical claim about pictures rather than a definition.\n</thinking_process>\n\nIs a definition: no\nWord defined: none",

It's more of a classificatory statement - placing pictures within the broader category of facts - rather than a definition that would allow us to identify what is and isn't a picture.\n\nA proper definition of \"picture\" would need to give us the essential characteristics that make something a picture, not just tell us that pictures are a type of fact.\n\nSimilarly, this doesn't define \"fact\" because it only tells us that pictures are facts, not what facts are in general.\n\nThis appears to be a philosophical claim or observation about the nature of pictures rather than a formal definition.\n</thinking_process>\n\nIs a definition: no\nWord defined: none",
