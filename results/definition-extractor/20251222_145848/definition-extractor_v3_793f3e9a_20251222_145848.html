Let me analyze this proposition: "The picture depicts reality by representing a possibility of the existence and non-existence of atomic facts."

First, I need to identify if this has the form "X is Y" or "X means Y".

The proposition states what "the picture" does - it "depicts reality by representing a possibility..." This is describing HOW a picture depicts reality, not defining what a picture IS.

This is more of a descriptive statement about the mechanism or method by which pictures depict reality. It explains the process or manner of depiction rather than providing a definition.

Let me check: If this were a definition, we would expect something like "A picture is X" where X provides necessary and sufficient conditions. Instead, we have "The picture depicts reality by..." which describes an action or function.

Also, applying the reversibility test: "A possibility of the existence and non-existence of atomic facts is a picture" - this doesn't hold as a valid reversal, confirming this isn't a proper definition.

This is a descriptive/explanatory statement about how pictures function, not a definition of what a picture is.

Consider the following proposition:

Not how the world is, is the mystical, but that it is.

State if this proposition is a definition.

Your answer must follow this format:
Is a definition: yes|no
Word defined: the word|none
</pre>
        <p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
        <pre><thinking_process>
Let me analyze this proposition: "Not how the world is, is the mystical, but that it is."

First, I need to identify if this has the form "X is Y" or "X means Y".

The proposition seems to be saying something about "the mystical" - specifically that the mystical is not about "how the world is" but rather "that it is" (i.e., the fact of the world's existence).

Restructuring: "The mystical is that the world is (exists), not how the world is."

So we have: "The mystical = that the world is (that it exists)"

This appears to have the form "X is Y" where X = "the mystical" and Y = "that the world is/exists".

Now let me check the reverse: "That the world is (exists) is the mystical" - does this hold? This seems to be exactly what the proposition is asserting - the sheer fact of existence is what constitutes the mystical.

Is Y providing meaningful, non-tautological information about X? Yes - it's telling us that "the mystical" refers to the bare fact of existence rather than the particular way things are.

Is this a definitional statement or merely a description/observation? This appears to be defining what "the mystical" means in a philosophical context - it's providing necessary and sufficient conditions for what constitutes "the mystical."

The proposition explicitly states what the mystical IS - it identifies the mystical with the fact of the world's existence (as opposed to its particular characteristics).

This seems to be a definition of "the mystical" - stating that the mystical is equivalent to the fact that the world exists.

        <pre><thinking_process>
Let me analyze this proposition: "The applied, thought, propositional sign, is the thought."

First, does it have the form "X is Y"?
Yes, it appears to state that "The applied, thought, propositional sign" is "the thought."

Second, let me check if Y provides meaningful, non-tautological information about X.
This is defining what "the thought" is - it is the applied, thought, propositional sign.

Third, is this a definitional statement?
The structure "X is Y" here seems to be defining "thought" as equivalent to "the applied, thought, propositional sign."

Fourth, let me consider the reverse: "The thought is the applied, thought, propositional sign" - does this also hold as true in a definitional sense? Yes, this appears to be establishing an equivalence/identity.

This is from Wittgenstein's Tractatus (3.5). It's establishing what "the thought" means in his philosophical framework - it is the propositional sign as applied and thought.

The proposition is providing a definition of "thought" (or "the thought") by identifying it with the applied propositional sign.

Looking at the example provided (Example 5), this exact proposition is classified as a definition with "thought" as the word defined.

Consider the following proposition:

5.523. The generality symbol occurs as an argument.

        <p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
        <pre><thinking_process>
Let me analyze this proposition: "The generality symbol occurs as an argument."

First, I need to identify if this has the form "X is/means Y".

The proposition states that "The generality symbol occurs as an argument." This is describing a property or behavior of the generality symbol - specifically, how it functions or appears (as an argument).

This is not in the form "X is Y" where Y defines what X is. Instead, it's describing what the generality symbol does or how it occurs.

Let me check the reverse: "An argument is the generality symbol" - this doesn't hold true, as arguments are not defined as generality symbols.

This is a descriptive statement about the generality symbol's role or function, not a definition of what the generality symbol is. It tells us something about how the generality symbol is used, but doesn't provide necessary and sufficient conditions for what constitutes a generality symbol.

This is more of an observation or description about the behavior/occurrence of the generality symbol rather than a definition.

1. The world is everything that is the case.

        <p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
        <pre><thinking_process>
Let me analyze the proposition: "The world is everything that is the case."

First, does it have the form "X is Y"?
Yes: "The world" (X) is "everything that is the case" (Y).

Second, does Y provide meaningful, non-tautological information about X?
Yes, "everything that is the case" provides substantive content about what "the world" means - it's defining the world as the totality of facts.

Third, is it a definitional statement rather than a description?
This appears to be a definitional statement. It's stating what the world IS in an essential, defining way.

Fourth, let me apply the reversibility test: "Y is X" - "Everything that is the case is the world."
This seems to hold true in the context of this definition. If the world is defined as everything that is the case, then everything that is the case would indeed constitute the world.

This is the opening proposition of Wittgenstein's Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus (proposition 1), and it functions as a definition of "the world" in his philosophical system. It provides necessary and sufficient conditions: the world is exactly the totality of what is the case (facts), no more and no less.

This is an explicit definition stating what "the world" means in this philosophical framework.

Let me analyze this proposition: "The world is the totality of facts, not of things."

First, does it have the form "X is Y"?
Yes, it states "The world is the totality of facts"

Second, let me check if Y provides meaningful, non-tautological information about X.
"The totality of facts" is not the same as "the world" - it provides substantive information.

Third, is this a definitional statement?
This appears to be defining what "the world" means - it's stating that the world IS (equals, is defined as) the totality of facts.

Fourth, let me apply the reversibility test: "The totality of facts is the world"
This seems to hold - if the world is defined as the totality of facts, then the totality of facts would be the world.

However, I need to consider whether this is truly a definition or more of a philosophical claim/thesis. In Wittgenstein's Tractatus, this is proposition 1.1, which is presenting his metaphysical view of what constitutes "the world."

The statement "The world is the totality of facts, not of things" does have definitional form. It's explicitly stating what the world IS - providing what appears to be necessary and sufficient conditions (the totality of facts, and explicitly NOT things).

This seems to be a genuine definition of "the world" in Wittgenstein's philosophical framework. It states that the world = the totality of facts, providing both what it is and what it is not.

Let me reconsider: Is this a description of the world or a definition? The form "X is Y" combined with the explicit contrast ("not of things") suggests this is meant to define what we should understand by "the world" - it's providing the essential nature/meaning of the term.

I believe this qualifies as a definition of "world" or "the world."

Consider the following proposition:

2.12. The picture is a model of reality.

</pre>
        <p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
        <pre><thinking_process>
Let me analyze the proposition: "The picture is a model of reality."

First, does it have the form "X is Y"?
Yes: "The picture" (X) is "a model of reality" (Y).

Second, does Y provide meaningful, non-tautological information about X?
"A model of reality" does provide information about what a picture is. It's not saying "a picture is a picture."

Third, is this a definitional statement or a description/observation?
This is from Wittgenstein's Tractatus. Let me consider whether this is truly a definition or more of a philosophical characterization/description.

Let me apply the reversibility test: "A model of reality is a picture" - is this true? Not necessarily. There could be other models of reality besides pictures (mathematical models, physical models, etc.). So "model of reality" is not equivalent to "picture" - it's a broader category.

This seems more like a characterization or description of what pictures are (or do) rather than a strict definition. It tells us something about pictures - that they function as models of reality - but it doesn't provide the necessary and sufficient conditions for something to be a picture.

A definition should work both ways: if X is defined as Y, then anything that is Y should be X. But not every model of reality is a picture.

This appears to be more of a philosophical thesis or characterization about the nature of pictures rather than a formal definition providing necessary and sufficient conditions.

However, I need to reconsider. In the context of the Tractatus, Wittgenstein might be defining what he means by "picture" in his technical sense. But even so, the statement seems to describe a property of pictures rather than define the term.

Comparing to the examples:
- "A bachelor is an unmarried man" - reversible: an unmarried man is a bachelor. Definition: yes.
- "A triangle is a polygon with three sides" - reversible: a polygon with three sides is a triangle. Definition: yes.
- "The applied, thought, propositional sign, is the thought" - this defines "thought" as the applied propositional sign.

For "The picture is a model of reality" - a model of reality is not necessarily a picture. This fails the reversibility test.

This seems more like a characterization or philosophical claim about pictures rather than a definition.

Let me analyze the proposition "The picture is a fact."

First, does it have the form "X is Y"? Yes, it states "The picture is a fact."

Second, let me check if this provides meaningful, non-tautological information. It states that a picture is a fact. This seems to be making a claim about what a picture is.

Third, is this a definitional statement or a description/observation? Let me consider the reversibility test: "A fact is a picture" - this would not be true, as not all facts are pictures. This suggests it's not a proper definition but rather a classification or descriptive statement about pictures.

The statement "The picture is a fact" tells us something about pictures (that they belong to the category of facts), but it doesn't provide necessary and sufficient conditions for what constitutes a picture. It's more of a classificatory statement - placing pictures within the broader category of facts - rather than a definition that would allow us to identify what is and isn't a picture.

A proper definition of "picture" would need to give us the essential characteristics that make something a picture, not just tell us that pictures are a type of fact.

Similarly, this doesn't define "fact" because it only tells us that pictures are facts, not what facts are in general.

This appears to be a philosophical claim or observation about the nature of pictures rather than a formal definition.

Consider the following proposition:

State if this proposition is a definition.

</pre>
        <p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
        <pre><thinking_process>
Let me analyze this proposition: "Substance is what exists independently of what is the case."

First, I need to identify if this has the form "X is Y":
- X = "Substance"
- Y = "what exists independently of what is the case"

This does have the form "X is Y".

Second, let me check if Y provides meaningful, non-tautological information about X:
- Y tells us that substance is characterized by existing independently of what is the case (i.e., independently of facts or states of affairs)
- This is not a tautology - it provides substantive information about what substance means

Third, let me verify if this is a definitional statement:
- This appears to be stating what substance IS, providing its essential characteristic
- It gives necessary and sufficient conditions: something is substance if and only if it exists independently of what is the case

Fourth, let me apply the reversibility test: "What exists independently of what is the case is substance"
- This seems to hold true in the Tractarian framework - if something exists independently of what is the case, it would be substance
- The definition appears to work in both directions

This proposition is providing a philosophical definition of "substance" in the context of Wittgenstein's Tractatus. It states what substance essentially is - that which exists independently of facts/states of affairs.

This is a clear definitional statement of the form "X is Y" where Y provides the defining characteristic of X.

Consider the following proposition:

</pre>
        <p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
        <pre><thinking_process>
Let me analyze this proposition: "The totality of existent atomic facts is the world."

First, does it have the form "X is Y"?
Yes: "The totality of existent atomic facts" (X) is "the world" (Y).

Second, does Y provide meaningful, non-tautological information about X?
This states that the world = the totality of existent atomic facts. This is providing a definition of what "the world" is.

Third, is it a definitional statement rather than a description?
This appears to be defining "the world" in terms of atomic facts. It's stating what the world IS, not merely describing a property of it.

Fourth, let me check the reversibility: "The world is the totality of existent atomic facts" - does this also hold as true? Yes, this seems to be a biconditional equivalence. The world is defined as exactly the totality of existent atomic facts, and the totality of existent atomic facts is exactly the world.

This is from Wittgenstein's Tractatus, and it does appear to be a definitional statement establishing what "the world" means in his philosophical framework. It provides necessary and sufficient conditions: the world is nothing more and nothing less than the totality of existent atomic facts.

The word being defined here is "world" (or "the world").
