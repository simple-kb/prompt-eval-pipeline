      "output": "<thinking_process>\nLet me analyze this proposition: \"Not how the world is, is the mystical, but that it is.\"\n\nFirst, I need to identify if this has the form \"X is/means Y\".\n\nThe proposition seems to be saying something about \"the mystical\" - specifically, it's contrasting what the mystical is NOT (how the world is) with what it IS (that the world is/exists).\n\nRestructured, this could be read as: \"The mystical is not how the world is, but that it is\" - which is essentially saying \"The mystical = that the world exists (not how it exists).\"\n\nThis does appear to have a definitional structure - it's telling us what \"the mystical\" is. It provides a characterization: the mystical is the fact of existence itself, not the particular way things are.\n\nHowever, let me consider whether this is truly a formal definition or more of a philosophical elucidation/characterization. \n\nLooking at the rules:\n- \"Philosophical elucidations or characterizations are not formal definitions\"\n- \"Definitions must state 'X is Y' or 'X means Y'\"\n\nThis proposition does state \"X is Y\" in a sense - \"the mystical is that [the world] is\" (i.e., the mystical is the bare fact of existence).\n\nBut is this a clear, explicit definition providing necessary and sufficient conditions? It seems more like a philosophical characterization of what Wittgenstein means by \"the mystical\" rather than a formal definition.\n\nActually, looking at Example 5: \"The applied, thought, propositional sign, is the thought\" - this was classified as a definition. This is also from Wittgenstein and has a similar philosophical character.\n\nThe structure here is: \"The mystical is [that the world is]\" - this does provide what the mystical IS, distinguishing it from what it is NOT.\n\nI think this could be considered a definition of \"the mystical\" - it explicitly states what the mystical is (the fact of existence, not the manner of existence).\n\nLet me reconsider. The proposition has the form: \"Not A is X, but B is X\" which can be rewritten as \"X is B (not A)\". So \"The mystical is that [the world] is.\"\n\nThis seems to be defining \"the mystical\" by stating what it is. It's an explicit statement of what the mystical means/is.\n\nI'll classify this as a definition of \"the mystical\" or \"mystical.\"\n</thinking_process>\n\nLooking at this proposition: \"Not how the world is, is the mystical, but that it is.\"\n\nThis can be restructured as: \"The mystical is not how the world is, but that it is\" - which effectively states \"The mystical = that the world exists (rather than how it exists).\"\n\nThis has the form \"X is Y\" where X = \"the mystical\" and Y = \"that [the world] is\" (the bare fact of existence).\n\nThe proposition explicitly identifies what \"the mystical\" is - it provides a characterization that distinguishes the mystical (the sheer fact of existence) from what it is not (the particular manner or content of existence).\n\nThis is an explicit definitional statement telling us what the term \"the mystical\" refers to.\n\nIs a definition: yes\nWord defined: mystical",
