However, it does not provide a definition in the strict sense. A definition would typically take the form \"X is...\" or \"X means...\" and would specify the essential nature or meaning of a concept.\n\nThis statement is more of an explanatory or descriptive claim about the function or role of pictures rather than a definition of what a picture is.

      "output": "Looking at this proposition: \"Not how the world is, is the mystical, but that it is.\"\n\nThis statement is making a substantive claim about the nature of the mystical - specifically that the mystical consists not in the particular way the world happens to be (its specific properties or states of affairs), but rather in the sheer fact of its existence. This is a philosophical thesis about what constitutes the mystical experience or dimension of reality.\n\nWhile the statement does tell us something about what \"the mystical\" refers to, it's not functioning as a definition in the strict sense. Rather, it's making a claim about where we should locate the mystical - in existence itself rather than in any particular features of what exists. A definition would typically take the form \"The mystical is...\" or \"By 'mystical' we mean...\" and would aim to give necessary and sufficient conditions for the term's application.\n\nThis appears to be a substantive philosophical claim (reminiscent of Wittgenstein's Tractus 6.44) rather than a definitional stipulation.\n\nIs a definition: no\nWord defined: none",
