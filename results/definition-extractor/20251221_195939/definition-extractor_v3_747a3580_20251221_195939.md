```

**Output:**
```
<thinking_process>
Let me analyze this proposition: "The picture depicts reality by representing a possibility of the existence and non-existence of atomic facts."

First, does this have the form "X is Y" or "X means Y"?
The proposition has the form "The picture depicts reality by [method]". This is describing HOW a picture depicts reality, not defining what a picture IS.

This is more of a descriptive or explanatory statement about the mechanism by which pictures depict reality. It tells us about the function or operation of pictures, but it doesn't provide a definition in the form "A picture is X" or "Depicting reality means X".

Let me check if we could interpret this as a definition:
- Could this be defining "picture"? No, it's describing what pictures do, not what they are.
- Could this be defining "depicts reality"? The statement explains how depicting happens, but it's not in definitional form.

The statement is a philosophical elucidation or characterization of how pictorial representation works, rather than a formal definition. It describes a property or function of pictures without providing necessary and sufficient conditions for what constitutes a picture.

Also, if I try to reverse it: "Representing a possibility of the existence and non-existence of atomic facts is how the picture depicts reality" - this doesn't work as a definition either.

This is a descriptive statement about the nature of pictorial representation, not a definition.

Consider the following proposition:

Not how the world is, is the mystical, but that it is.

State if this proposition is a definition.

Your answer must follow this format:
Is a definition: yes|no
Word defined: the word|none

```

**Output:**
```
<thinking_process>
Let me analyze this proposition: "Not how the world is, is the mystical, but that it is."

First, I need to identify if this has the form "X is Y" or "X means Y".

The proposition seems to be saying something about "the mystical" - specifically that the mystical is not about "how the world is" but rather "that it is" (i.e., the fact of the world's existence).

Let me restructure this: "The mystical is not how the world is, but that it is."

This could be read as: "The mystical = that the world is (exists)" or more precisely "The mystical is the fact that the world exists, not the manner in which it exists."

Now, let me check if this is a definition by considering the reverse: "That the world is (exists) is the mystical." Does this hold? It seems like Wittgenstein is indeed characterizing what counts as "the mystical" - the sheer fact of existence rather than the particular way things are.

However, I need to consider whether this is a formal definition or more of a philosophical characterization/elucidation. 

Looking at the structure, it's more of a contrastive statement - it's telling us what the mystical is NOT (how the world is) and what it IS (that it is). This does seem to provide a characterization of "the mystical."

But is this a strict definition with necessary and sufficient conditions? The statement "the mystical is that the world is" - does "that the world is" provide necessary and sufficient conditions for something being mystical?

This seems more like a philosophical elucidation or characterization rather than a formal definition. It's describing what Wittgenstein considers to be the mystical aspect of existence, but it's not providing a clear definitional equivalence in the traditional sense.

Also, "that it is" is quite vague and doesn't provide clear, explicit definitional content. It's more of a philosophical insight or observation about the nature of the mystical.

Following my rules: "Philosophical elucidations or characterizations are not formal definitions."

I would classify this as NOT a definition - it's a philosophical characterization of "the mystical" rather than a formal definition.

State if this proposition is a definition.

Your answer must follow this format:
Is a definition: yes|no
Word defined: the word|none

```

**Output:**
```
<thinking_process>
Let me analyze this proposition: "The applied, thought, propositional sign, is the thought."

First, does it have the form "X is Y"?
Yes, it appears to say: "The applied, thought, propositional sign" is "the thought"

So X = "The applied, thought, propositional sign"
Y = "the thought"

Second, let me check if Y provides meaningful, non-tautological information about X.
This is stating that when a propositional sign is applied and thought, it IS the thought. This seems to be defining what "the thought" is - namely, it is the applied, thought propositional sign.

Third, is this a definitional statement rather than a description?
This appears to be from Wittgenstein's Tractatus. It's stating an identity: the thought = the applied, thought, propositional sign.

Let me apply the reversibility test: "Y is X" - "The thought is the applied, thought, propositional sign." Does this also hold true as a definition? Yes, it seems to work both ways - it's establishing an identity/equivalence.

This is providing necessary and sufficient conditions for what constitutes "the thought" - it is precisely the applied, thought propositional sign.

Looking at the example provided (Example 5), this exact proposition is given and classified as:
- Is a definition: yes
- Word defined: thought

So this is defining "thought" as the applied, thought propositional sign.

Is a definition: yes

5.523. The generality symbol occurs as an argument.

State if this proposition is a definition.

Your answer must follow this format:

```

**Output:**
```
<thinking_process>
Let me analyze this proposition: "The generality symbol occurs as an argument."

First, I need to identify if this has the form "X is/means Y".

The proposition states that "The generality symbol occurs as an argument." This is describing a behavior or property of the generality symbol - specifically, how it functions or appears in logical notation.

This is not saying "The generality symbol IS an argument" - it's saying the generality symbol "occurs as" an argument, which is a description of how it functions or appears, not a definition of what it is.

Let me check the reversal test: "An argument is the generality symbol" - this clearly doesn't work and isn't what the proposition is claiming.

This is a descriptive statement about the role or function of the generality symbol in logical notation, not a definition of what the generality symbol is or what an argument is.

It doesn't provide necessary and sufficient conditions for either "generality symbol" or "argument."

This is a philosophical observation or characterization about logical notation, not a formal definition.

**Output:**
```
<thinking_process>
Let me analyze this proposition: "The world is everything that is the case."

First, does it have the form "X is Y"?
Yes: X = "The world" and Y = "everything that is the case"

Second, does Y provide meaningful, non-tautological information about X?
Y = "everything that is the case" - this provides a characterization of what "the world" means. It's not simply restating "the world" in different words that mean the same thing.

Third, is it a definitional statement rather than a description or observation?
This is the opening proposition of Wittgenstein's Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus. It appears to be stating what "the world" IS - providing a definition of the term.

Fourth, let me apply the reversibility test: "Y is X" - "Everything that is the case is the world."
If the world is defined as everything that is the case, then everything that is the case would indeed be the world. This seems to hold.

This proposition states that "the world" equals "everything that is the case" - it provides necessary and sufficient conditions for what constitutes "the world." It's not merely describing a property of the world, but defining what the world IS.

This appears to be a genuine definition of "the world" in Wittgenstein's philosophical system.

**Output:**

<thinking_process>
Let me analyze this proposition: "The world is the totality of facts, not of things."

First, does it have the form "X is Y"?
Yes, it states "The world is the totality of facts"

Second, let me check if Y provides meaningful, non-tautological information about X.
"The totality of facts" does provide substantive information about what "the world" is.

Third, is this a definitional statement or a description/observation?
This appears to be Wittgenstein defining what he means by "the world" in the Tractatus. He is stating that the world = the totality of facts.

Fourth, let me apply the reversibility test: "The totality of facts is the world"
This seems to hold - if the world is defined as the totality of facts, then the totality of facts would be the world.

However, I need to consider whether this is truly a formal definition or more of a philosophical characterization/thesis. Wittgenstein is making a philosophical claim about the nature of the world - that it should be understood as consisting of facts rather than things. This is more of a philosophical thesis or elucidation about how we should conceive of "the world" rather than a strict lexical definition.

But looking at the structure, it does have the definitional form "X is Y" where X = "the world" and Y = "the totality of facts". The addition "not of things" serves to clarify and distinguish, which is common in definitions.

Comparing to the examples:
- Example 5: "The applied, thought, propositional sign, is the thought" was marked as a definition
- Example 3: "The law of causality is not a law but the form of a law" was marked as NOT a definition

The difference seems to be that Example 3 is more of a characterization (saying what something is NOT and what form it takes), while Example 5 provides an identity.

"The world is the totality of facts" does provide an identity statement - it equates "the world" with "the totality of facts."

I think this qualifies as a definition. Wittgenstein is defining his use of "the world" as meaning the totality of facts.

Yes: "The picture" (X) is "a model of reality" (Y).

Second, let me check if Y provides meaningful, non-tautological information about X.
"A model of reality" does provide some information about what a picture is.

Third, is this a definitional statement or a description/observation?
This is from Wittgenstein's Tractatus. Let me consider whether this is truly a definition or more of a philosophical characterization/elucidation.

Let me apply the reversibility test: "A model of reality is a picture" - is this true? Not necessarily. There could be other models of reality besides pictures (mathematical models, physical models, etc.). So "model of reality" is not equivalent to "picture" - it's a broader category.

This statement tells us something about pictures - that they function as models of reality - but it doesn't provide necessary and sufficient conditions for what constitutes a picture. It's more of a characterization or description of what pictures do or how they relate to reality.

A proper definition would give us conditions that are both necessary AND sufficient. Here, being "a model of reality" may be necessary for being a picture (in Wittgenstein's sense), but it's not sufficient - not every model of reality is a picture.

This appears to be a philosophical elucidation or characterization rather than a formal definition. It describes a property or function of pictures rather than defining what a picture is in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions.

Let me analyze the proposition "The picture is a fact."

First, does it have the form "X is Y"? Yes, it states "The picture is a fact."

Second, let me check if this provides meaningful, non-tautological information. It says that a picture is a fact. This seems to be stating something about the nature of pictures.

Third, is this a definitional statement or a description/observation? Let me apply the reversibility test: "A fact is a picture" - this would not be true, as not all facts are pictures. This asymmetry suggests this is more of a characterization or classification of pictures rather than a formal definition.

Also, in the context of Wittgenstein's Tractatus (which this appears to be from), this is more of a philosophical claim or characterization about the nature of pictures rather than a formal definition. It's telling us something about pictures (that they belong to the category of facts), but it's not providing necessary and sufficient conditions for what constitutes a picture.

A definition would need to work both ways - if "picture" were defined as "fact," then any fact would be a picture, which is clearly not the intent here. This is more of a classificatory statement placing pictures within the broader category of facts.

This appears to be a descriptive/characterizing statement rather than a formal definition.

### proposition 2.024 ✅

**System Prompt:**
```
You are a philosopher specializing in logic and philosophy of language.

<rules>
- Only classify clear, explicit definitions
- Definitions must state "X is Y" or "X means Y"
- If you identify the form "X is Y", consider "Y is X" and evaluate its truthness. A definition must verify also "Y is X"
- A definition provides necessary and sufficient conditions in the traditional definitional sense
- Implicit or contextual definitions should be marked as "no"
- Tautologies (e.g., "X is X") are not definitions
- Descriptive statements without definitional intent are not definitions
- Philosophical elucidations or characterizations are not formal definitions
</rules>

<skills>
- Formal logic analysis
- Semantic decomposition
- Linguistic pattern recognition
- Distinguishing definitions from descriptions
</skills>

<thinking_process>
First, identify if the proposition has the form "X is/means Y".
Second, check if Y provides meaningful, non-tautological information about X.
Third, verify it's a definitional statement rather than a description or observation.
Fourth, extract the term being defined if it is a definition.

<examples>

Example 1:
input: A bachelor is an unmarried man
output: Is a definition: yes
Word defined: bachelor

Example 2:
input: If the form of representation is the logical form, then the picture is called a logical picture.
output: Is a definition: no
Word defined: none

Example 3:
input: The law of causality is not a law but the form of a law.
output: Is a definition: no
Word defined: none

Example 4:
input: A triangle is a polygon with three sides
output: Is a definition: yes
Word defined: triangle

Example 5:
input: The applied, thought, propositional sign, is the thought

Consider the following proposition:

2.024. Substance is what exists independently of what is the case.

State if this proposition is a definition.

Your answer must follow this format:
Is a definition: yes|no
Word defined: the word|none

```

**Output:**
```
<thinking_process>
Let me analyze this proposition: "Substance is what exists independently of what is the case."

First, does it have the form "X is Y"?
Yes: "Substance is what exists independently of what is the case"
X = Substance
Y = what exists independently of what is the case

Second, does Y provide meaningful, non-tautological information about X?
Yes, it tells us that substance is characterized by existing independently of what is the case (i.e., independently of facts).

Third, is this a definitional statement rather than a description?
This appears to be stating what substance IS - providing a characterization that could serve as a definition.

Fourth, let me check the reversibility: "What exists independently of what is the case is substance."
This seems to hold - if something exists independently of what is the case, it would be substance according to this framework.

This proposition provides necessary and sufficient conditions for something being "substance" - it must exist independently of what is the case. This is a classic definitional form where the definiendum (substance) is equated with the definiens (what exists independently of what is the case).

This appears to be a genuine definition of "substance" in Wittgenstein's philosophical framework.

Consider the following proposition:

2.04. The totality of existent atomic facts is the world.

State if this proposition is a definition.

Your answer must follow this format:
Is a definition: yes|no
Word defined: the word|none

```

**Output:**
```
<thinking_process>
Let me analyze this proposition: "The totality of existent atomic facts is the world."

First, does it have the form "X is Y"?
Yes: "The totality of existent atomic facts" (X) is "the world" (Y).

Second, does Y provide meaningful, non-tautological information about X?
This states that the world = the totality of existent atomic facts.

Third, is this a definitional statement?
Let me check the reversibility: "The world is the totality of existent atomic facts" - this would also be true according to Wittgenstein's framework. This appears to be defining what "the world" is.

This is from Wittgenstein's Tractatus. He is providing a definition of "the world" - stating what the world consists of or what it means. The proposition establishes that "the world" is equivalent to "the totality of existent atomic facts."

Let me verify: If we reverse it - "The world is the totality of existent atomic facts" - this seems to hold as well. The statement provides necessary and sufficient conditions for what constitutes "the world."

This appears to be a genuine definition of "the world" in Wittgenstein's philosophical system. It's not merely a description but a statement of what the world IS in a definitional sense.

The word being defined is "world" (or "the world").
