Consider the following proposition:

The picture depicts reality by representing a possibility of the existence and non-existence of atomic facts.

State if this proposition is a definition.

Your answer must follow this format:
Is a definition: yes|no
Word defined: the word|none
</pre>
        <p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
        <pre><thinking_process>
First, let me identify if this proposition has the form "X is/means Y":
- The proposition states: "The picture depicts reality by representing a possibility of the existence and non-existence of atomic facts."
- This does not have the explicit form "X is Y" or "X means Y"
- Instead, it describes what "the picture" does - it "depicts reality by representing..."

Second, let me check if this provides a definitional statement:
- This appears to be describing a function or activity of "the picture" rather than defining what a picture is
- It's explaining how pictures work or what they do, not what they are essentially
- The structure is "X does Y by doing Z" rather than "X is Y"

Third, let me verify if this is definitional vs. descriptive:
- This reads as a descriptive/explanatory statement about the mechanism by which pictures represent reality
- It's not stating the essential nature or meaning of "picture" but rather describing its representational function
- This is more of a philosophical characterization of how pictorial representation works

Fourth, checking the reverse "Y is X":
- If we tried to reverse this, we'd get something like "representing a possibility of the existence and non-existence of atomic facts is the picture" - this doesn't make sense as a definition and shows this isn't a proper definitional form.

This is a descriptive statement about how pictures function, not a definition of what a picture is.

Consider the following proposition:

Not how the world is, is the mystical, but that it is.

State if this proposition is a definition.

Your answer must follow this format:
Is a definition: yes|no
Word defined: the word|none
</pre>
        <p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
        <pre><thinking_process>
First, let me identify if this proposition has the form "X is/means Y":
"Not how the world is, is the mystical, but that it is."

This can be restructured as: "The mystical is not how the world is, but that it is."

So we have: "The mystical is [not how the world is, but that it is]"

This appears to have the form "X is Y" where X = "the mystical" and Y = "not how the world is, but that it is."

Second, let me check if Y provides meaningful, non-tautological information about X:
The statement provides substantive content about what "the mystical" is - it's making a distinction between the "how" and the "that" of the world's existence.

Third, let me verify if this is a definitional statement:
This appears to be defining what "the mystical" means by contrasting it with what it is not (how the world is) and stating what it is (that the world is).

Fourth, let me check the reverse: "Not how the world is, but that it is, is the mystical" - this would also be true if we accept the original definition, so the biconditional relationship holds.

This appears to be a formal definition of "the mystical."

</pre>
        <p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
        <pre><thinking_process>
First, let me identify if this proposition has the form "X is/means Y":
- "The applied, thought, propositional sign, is the thought"
- This has the form "X is Y" where X = "the applied, thought, propositional sign" and Y = "the thought"

Second, let me check if Y provides meaningful, non-tautological information about X:
- X is "the applied, thought, propositional sign" 
- Y is "the thought"
- This is not a tautology since X and Y are not identical expressions

Third, let me verify if this is a definitional statement:
- The statement equates "the applied, thought, propositional sign" with "the thought"
- This appears to be defining what "the thought" is in terms of "the applied, thought, propositional sign"
- However, I need to consider which term is being defined

Fourth, let me check the reversibility test "Y is X":
- "The thought is the applied, thought, propositional sign"
- This seems to work as a definitional equivalence

Looking at the structure, this appears to be defining "thought" as equivalent to "the applied, thought, propositional sign." The statement is providing a definitional equivalence between these two concepts.

Consider the following proposition:

5.523. The generality symbol occurs as an argument.

Your answer must follow this format:

        <pre><thinking_process>
First, let me identify if this proposition has the form "X is/means Y":
"The generality symbol occurs as an argument."

This statement does not have the definitional form "X is Y" or "X means Y". Instead, it's making a descriptive statement about where or how the generality symbol occurs - specifically that it occurs "as an argument."

Second, let me check if this provides definitional information:
The statement is describing a property or characteristic of the generality symbol (that it occurs as an argument), but it's not defining what the generality symbol IS. It's telling us something about its function or role, not providing its essential nature or meaning.

Third, let me verify if it's definitional vs. descriptive:
This appears to be a descriptive statement about the behavior or usage of the generality symbol rather than a definition of what it is. It's more like saying "X does Y" rather than "X is Y."

The statement doesn't establish necessary and sufficient conditions for what constitutes a generality symbol, nor does it provide the meaning or essence of the term.

Consider the following proposition:

        <pre><thinking_process>
First, let me identify if this proposition has the form "X is/means Y":
- "The world is the totality of facts, not of things"
- This does have the form "X is Y" where X = "the world" and Y = "the totality of facts, not of things"

Second, let me check if Y provides meaningful, non-tautological information about X:
- "The totality of facts, not of things" does provide substantive information about what "the world" means
- This is not a tautology like "the world is the world"

Third, let me verify if this is a definitional statement rather than a description or observation:
- The statement appears to be making a definitional claim about what "the world" fundamentally is
- It's not merely describing an observed property but stating what the world consists of essentially
- The contrast "not of things" suggests this is meant to clarify the proper understanding of the term

Fourth, let me check the reverse: "Y is X" - would "the totality of facts, not of things" be "the world"? 
- Yes, this seems to work as a bidirectional definition - if the world is defined as the totality of facts, then the totality of facts would constitute the world.

This appears to be a formal definition of "the world" in philosophical terms.

Consider the following proposition:

2.12. The picture is a model of reality.

State if this proposition is a definition.

Your answer must follow this format:
Is a definition: yes|no
Word defined: the word|none
</pre>
        <p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
        <pre><thinking_process>
First, let me identify if this proposition has the form "X is/means Y":
- "The picture is a model of reality"
- This has the form "X is Y" where X = "the picture" and Y = "a model of reality"

Second, let me check if Y provides meaningful, non-tautological information about X:
- "A model of reality" does provide substantive information about what a picture is
- This is not tautological (not "picture is picture")

Third, let me verify if this is a definitional statement rather than a description:
- The statement "The picture is a model of reality" appears to be making a definitional claim about the nature of pictures
- It's stating what a picture essentially is, not just describing a property it might have

Fourth, let me check the bidirectional test - if "picture is a model of reality" then would "a model of reality is a picture"?
- This doesn't seem to work bidirectionally. Not all models of reality are pictures (there could be other types of models)
- This suggests it might be more of a characterization than a strict definition

However, looking at the context and the numbered format (2.12), this appears to be from Wittgenstein's Tractus, where such statements are often definitional in nature within his philosophical system. The statement does seem to be providing an essential characterization of what pictures are in his logical framework.

But applying the strict rules given, particularly the bidirectional test, this seems more like a philosophical characterization than a formal definition that provides necessary and sufficient conditions.

        <p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
        <pre><thinking_process>
First, let me identify if this proposition has the form "X is/means Y":
- "The picture is a fact" - this does have the form "X is Y" where X = "the picture" and Y = "a fact"

Second, let me check if Y provides meaningful, non-tautological information about X:
- "a fact" does provide meaningful information about "the picture" - it's not tautological

Third, let me verify if this is a definitional statement rather than a description or observation:
- This appears to be stating what a picture fundamentally is, which seems definitional in nature
- However, I need to consider if "Y is X" also holds true: "A fact is the picture" - this doesn't seem to be necessarily true, as there are many facts that are not pictures

Fourth, let me consider the context and whether this meets the strict criteria for a definition:
- While this has the form "X is Y", it seems more like a philosophical characterization or assertion about the nature of pictures rather than a formal definition
- A definition should provide necessary and sufficient conditions, but this seems to be making a broader philosophical claim
- The statement appears to be asserting something about the ontological status of pictures rather than defining what the term "picture" means

Given the strict criteria in the rules, this appears to be more of a philosophical assertion or characterization rather than a formal definition.

First, let me identify if this proposition has the form "X is/means Y":
- "Substance is what exists independently of what is the case"
- This has the form "Substance is [what exists independently of what is the case]"

Second, let me check if Y provides meaningful, non-tautological information about X:
- The predicate "what exists independently of what is the case" provides substantive information about what substance means
- This is not tautological (not "substance is substance")

Third, let me verify it's a definitional statement rather than a description:
- The structure "X is Y" where Y specifies the essential nature or meaning of X appears definitional
- This seems to be stating what substance means or what constitutes substance

Fourth, let me check the bidirectionality test - if "substance is what exists independently of what is the case," does "what exists independently of what is the case is substance"?
- This seems to work as a definitional equivalence - the statement appears to be providing necessary and sufficient conditions for something to be substance

This appears to be a formal definition providing the essential characteristics that define substance.
