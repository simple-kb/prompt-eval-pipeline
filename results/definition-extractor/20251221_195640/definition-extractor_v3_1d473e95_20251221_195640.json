Not all models of reality are pictures (there could be other types of models)\n- This suggests it might be more of a characterization than a strict definition\n\nHowever, looking at the context and the numbered format (2.12), this appears to be from Wittgenstein's Tractus, where such statements are often definitional in nature within his philosophical system. The statement does seem to be providing an essential characterization of what pictures are in his logical framework.\n\nBut applying the strict rules given, particularly the bidirectional test, this seems more like a philosophical characterization than a formal definition that provides necessary and sufficient conditions.\n</thinking_process>\n\nIs a definition: no\nWord defined: none",
