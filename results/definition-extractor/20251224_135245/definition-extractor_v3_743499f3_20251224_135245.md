**Output:**

<thinking_process>
Let me analyze this proposition: "The picture depicts reality by representing a possibility of the existence and non-existence of atomic facts."

First, I need to identify if this has the form "X is Y" or "X means Y".

The proposition states what "the picture" does - it "depicts reality by representing a possibility..." This is describing HOW a picture depicts reality, not defining what a picture IS.

This is more of a descriptive statement about the mechanism or method by which pictures depict reality. It explains the process or manner of depiction rather than providing a definition.

Let me check: If this were a definition, we would expect something like "A picture is X" where X provides necessary and sufficient conditions. Instead, we have "The picture depicts reality by..." which describes an action or function.

Also, applying the reversibility test: "A possibility of the existence and non-existence of atomic facts is the picture" - this doesn't make sense as a definition.

This is a descriptive/explanatory statement about how pictures function, not a definition of what a picture is.

Consider the following proposition:

Not how the world is, is the mystical, but that it is.

State if this proposition is a definition.

Your answer must follow this format:
Is a definition: yes|no
Word defined: the word|none

```

**Output:**
```
<thinking_process>
Let me analyze this proposition: "Not how the world is, is the mystical, but that it is."

First, I need to identify if this has the form "X is Y" or "X means Y".

The proposition seems to be saying something about "the mystical" - specifically that the mystical is not about "how the world is" but rather "that it is" (i.e., the fact of the world's existence).

Restructuring: "The mystical is that the world is (exists), not how the world is."

So we have: "The mystical = that the world is (that it exists)"

This appears to have the form "X is Y" where X = "the mystical" and Y = "that the world is/exists".

Now let me check the reverse: "That the world is (exists) is the mystical" - does this hold? The proposition seems to be making exactly this claim - that the sheer fact of existence is what constitutes the mystical.

Is this a tautology? No, "the mystical" and "that the world is" are different concepts.

Is this providing necessary and sufficient conditions? It seems to be stating what the mystical IS - defining it as the fact of existence rather than the manner of existence.

Is this a description or a definition? This appears to be a definitional statement about what constitutes "the mystical" - it's telling us what the mystical means or what it is.

The proposition is providing a definition of "the mystical" by stating that it consists in the fact that the world exists, not in how it exists.

This seems to be a genuine definition - it's stating what "the mystical" is in a definitional sense.

Is a definition: yes

```

**Output:**
```
<thinking_process>
Let me analyze this proposition: "The applied, thought, propositional sign, is the thought."

First, does it have the form "X is Y"?
Yes, it states that "The applied, thought, propositional sign" is "the thought."

Second, let me check if this provides meaningful, non-tautological information.
The subject is "the applied, thought, propositional sign" - this appears to be a complex term describing a propositional sign that is applied and thought.
The predicate is "the thought."

This seems to be defining what "the thought" is - namely, it is the applied, thought, propositional sign.

Third, let me verify the reversibility test: "Y is X" - "The thought is the applied, thought, propositional sign." This would also be true if this is a genuine definition.

This appears to be a definitional statement from Wittgenstein's Tractatus, where he is defining what constitutes "the thought" - it is the propositional sign as applied and thought.

Wait, I need to be careful here. The proposition contains "thought" in both the subject ("the applied, thought, propositional sign") and the predicate ("the thought"). However, in the subject, "thought" is used as an adjective/participle modifying "propositional sign," while in the predicate, "the thought" is a noun being defined.

This is providing a definition of "thought" (as a noun) - stating that a thought is a propositional sign that has been applied and thought (processed mentally).

The example given shows this exact proposition with the answer "yes" and "thought" as the word defined. So this is indeed a definition of "thought."

5.523. The generality symbol occurs as an argument.

State if this proposition is a definition.

Your answer must follow this format:
Is a definition: yes|no

```

**Output:**
```
<thinking_process>
Let me analyze this proposition: "The generality symbol occurs as an argument."

First, I need to identify if this has the form "X is/means Y".

The proposition states that "The generality symbol occurs as an argument." This is describing a property or behavior of the generality symbol - specifically, how it functions or appears (as an argument).

This is not in the form "X is Y" where Y defines what X is. Rather, it's stating something about how X (the generality symbol) behaves or is used.

Let me check the reverse: "An argument is the generality symbol" - this would be false, as arguments can be many things, not just the generality symbol.

This is a descriptive statement about the generality symbol's role or occurrence, not a definition of what the generality symbol is. It tells us something about the generality symbol but doesn't provide necessary and sufficient conditions for what constitutes a generality symbol.

This is more of an observation or description about how the generality symbol functions in logical notation, rather than a definition.

```

**Output:**
```
<thinking_process>
Let me analyze the proposition: "The world is everything that is the case."

First, does it have the form "X is Y"?
Yes: "The world" (X) is "everything that is the case" (Y).

Second, does Y provide meaningful, non-tautological information about X?
Yes, "everything that is the case" provides substantive content about what "the world" means - it's defining the world as the totality of facts.

Third, is it a definitional statement rather than a description?
This appears to be a definitional statement. It's stating what the world IS in an essential, defining way.

Fourth, let me apply the reversibility test: "Y is X" - "Everything that is the case is the world."
This seems to hold true in the context of this definition. If the world is defined as everything that is the case, then everything that is the case would indeed constitute the world.

This is the opening proposition of Wittgenstein's Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, and it functions as a definition of "the world" in his philosophical system. It provides necessary and sufficient conditions: the world is exactly the totality of what is the case (facts), no more and no less.

This is an explicit definition stating what "the world" means in this philosophical context.

**Output:**

<thinking_process>
Let me analyze this proposition: "The world is the totality of facts, not of things."

First, does it have the form "X is Y"?
Yes, it states "The world is the totality of facts"

Second, let me check if Y provides meaningful, non-tautological information about X.
"The totality of facts" is not the same as "the world" - it provides substantive information.

Third, is this a definitional statement?
This appears to be defining what "the world" means - it's stating that the world IS (equals, is defined as) the totality of facts.

Fourth, let me apply the reversibility test: "The totality of facts is the world"
This seems to hold - if the world is defined as the totality of facts, then the totality of facts would be the world.

However, I need to consider whether this is truly a definition or more of a philosophical claim/thesis. In Wittgenstein's Tractatus, this is proposition 1.1, which is making a philosophical assertion about the nature of the world. 

But looking at the structure, it does have the definitional form "X is Y" where it's stating what the world IS. The phrase "not of things" further clarifies the definition by exclusion.

This is from Wittgenstein's Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, and it does appear to be providing a definition of "the world" - stating that the world should be understood as the totality of facts rather than things.

The statement "The world is the totality of facts" does provide necessary and sufficient conditions for what constitutes "the world" in Wittgenstein's framework.

Let me reconsider: Is this a description of the world or a definition? It seems to be stipulating what "the world" means in the context of the Tractatus - it's defining the term for philosophical purposes.

I believe this qualifies as a definition of "world" or "the world."

**Output:**
```
<thinking_process>
Let me analyze this proposition: "The picture is a model of reality."

First, does it have the form "X is Y"?
Yes: "The picture" is X, and "a model of reality" is Y.

Second, does Y provide meaningful, non-tautological information about X?
"A model of reality" does provide some information about what a picture is.

Third, is this a definitional statement or a description/observation?
This is where I need to be careful. Let me apply the reversibility test: "A model of reality is a picture" - is this true? Not necessarily. There could be many models of reality that are not pictures (mathematical models, physical models, mental models, etc.). So the relationship is not bidirectional in the way a proper definition would require.

A definition should provide necessary and sufficient conditions. While this proposition tells us something about pictures (that they are models of reality), it doesn't seem to provide sufficient conditions - not every model of reality is a picture.

This appears more like a characterization or description of what pictures do or how they function, rather than a strict definition that provides necessary and sufficient conditions for something to be a picture.

In the context of Wittgenstein's Tractatus, this is more of a philosophical claim about the nature of pictures rather than a formal definition. It's describing a property or function of pictures.

Following the rules strictly: a definition must verify "Y is X" as well. "A model of reality is a picture" is not true (there are other models of reality), so this fails the reversibility test.

This is a descriptive statement about pictures, not a definition.

**Output:**
```
<thinking_process>
Let me analyze the proposition "The picture is a fact."

First, does it have the form "X is Y"? Yes, it states "The picture is a fact."

Second, let me check if this provides meaningful, non-tautological information. It says that a picture is a fact. This seems to be making a claim about what a picture is.

Third, is this a definitional statement or a description/observation? Let me consider the reverse: "A fact is a picture" - this would not be true, as not all facts are pictures. This asymmetry suggests this is more of a classification or descriptive statement about pictures rather than a definition.

A definition should provide necessary and sufficient conditions. If "the picture is a fact" were a definition, then being a fact would be both necessary and sufficient for being a picture. But clearly not all facts are pictures - there are many facts that are not pictures.

This appears to be a philosophical claim or observation about the nature of pictures (in Wittgenstein's Tractatus context), stating that pictures belong to the category of facts. It's classifying pictures as a type of fact, but it's not defining what a picture is in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions.

This is more like saying "A dog is a mammal" - which classifies dogs but doesn't define them (not all mammals are dogs).

### proposition 2.024 ✅

**System Prompt:**
```
You are a philosopher specializing in logic and philosophy of language.

<rules>
- Only classify clear, explicit definitions
- Definitions must state "X is Y" or "X means Y"
- If you identify the form "X is Y", consider "Y is X" and evaluate its truthness. A definition must verify also "Y is X"
- A definition provides necessary and sufficient conditions in the traditional definitional sense
- Implicit or contextual definitions should be marked as "no"
- Tautologies (e.g., "X is X") are not definitions
- Descriptive statements without definitional intent are not definitions
</rules>

<skills>
- Formal logic analysis
- Semantic decomposition
- Linguistic pattern recognition
- Distinguishing definitions from descriptions
</skills>

<thinking_process>
First, identify if the proposition has the form "X is/means Y".
Second, check if Y provides meaningful, non-tautological information about X.
Third, verify it's a definitional statement rather than a description or observation.
Fourth, extract the term being defined if it is a definition.

Consider the following proposition:

2.024. Substance is what exists independently of what is the case.

State if this proposition is a definition.

Your answer must follow this format:
Is a definition: yes|no
Word defined: the word|none

```

**Output:**
```
<thinking_process>
Let me analyze this proposition: "Substance is what exists independently of what is the case."

First, I need to identify if this has the form "X is Y":
- X = "Substance"
- Y = "what exists independently of what is the case"

This does have the form "X is Y".

Second, let me check if Y provides meaningful, non-tautological information about X:
- Y tells us that substance is characterized by existing independently of what is the case (i.e., independently of facts or states of affairs)
- This is not a tautology - it provides substantive information about what substance means

Third, let me verify if it's a definitional statement:
- This appears to be stating what substance IS, providing necessary and sufficient conditions
- It's from Wittgenstein's Tractatus, where he is establishing the meaning of key terms

Fourth, let me apply the reversibility test: "Y is X" - "What exists independently of what is the case is substance"
- This seems to hold - if something exists independently of what is the case, it would be substance according to this framework
- The definition appears to work in both directions

This appears to be a genuine definition of "substance" in the philosophical/technical sense Wittgenstein is using it. It provides the necessary and sufficient conditions for something to be called "substance" - namely, that it exists independently of what is the case.

Consider the following proposition:

2.04. The totality of existent atomic facts is the world.

State if this proposition is a definition.

Your answer must follow this format:
Is a definition: yes|no
Word defined: the word|none

```

**Output:**
```
<thinking_process>
Let me analyze this proposition: "The totality of existent atomic facts is the world."

First, does it have the form "X is Y"?
Yes: "The totality of existent atomic facts" (X) is "the world" (Y).

Second, does Y provide meaningful, non-tautological information about X?
This states that "the world" equals "the totality of existent atomic facts." This is providing a definition of what "the world" means in Wittgenstein's framework.

Third, let me check the reversibility: "The world is the totality of existent atomic facts" - this would also be true and meaningful. In fact, this is essentially how Wittgenstein defines "the world" in the Tractatus.

Fourth, is this a definitional statement rather than a description?
This appears to be a definitional statement. It's stating what the world IS in an essential, definitional sense - providing necessary and sufficient conditions. The world is defined as being constituted by the totality of existent atomic facts.

The term being defined here is "the world" - Wittgenstein is telling us what the world means/is in his philosophical framework.

This is a definition of "world" - it provides the necessary and sufficient conditions for what constitutes "the world."

Is a definition: yes
