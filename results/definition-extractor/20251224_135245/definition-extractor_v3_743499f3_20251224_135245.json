The proposition contains \"thought\" in both the subject (\"the applied, thought, propositional sign\") and the predicate (\"the thought\"). However, in the subject, \"thought\" is used as an adjective/participle modifying \"propositional sign,\" while in the predicate, \"the thought\" is a noun being defined.\n\nThis is providing a definition of \"thought\" (as a noun) - stating that a thought is a propositional sign that has been applied and thought (processed mentally).\n\nThe example given shows this exact proposition with the answer \"yes\" and \"thought\" as the word defined.

Let me apply the reversibility test: \"A model of reality is a picture\" - is this true? Not necessarily. There could be many models of reality that are not pictures (mathematical models, physical models, mental models, etc.). So the relationship is not bidirectional in the way a proper definition would require.\n\nA definition should provide necessary and sufficient conditions. While this proposition tells us something about pictures (that they are models of reality), it doesn't seem to provide sufficient conditions - not every model of reality is a picture.\n\nThis appears more like a characterization or description of what pictures do or how they function, rather than a strict definition that provides necessary and sufficient conditions for something to be a picture.\n\nIn the context of Wittgenstein's Tractatus, this is more of a philosophical claim about the nature of pictures rather than a formal definition. It's describing a property or function of pictures.\n\nFollowing the rules strictly: a definition must verify \"Y is X\" as well. \"A model of reality is a picture\" is not true (there are other models of reality), so this fails the reversibility test.\n\nThis is a descriptive statement about pictures, not a definition.\n</thinking_process>\n\nIs a definition: no\nWord defined: none",

Yes, it states \"The picture is a fact.\"\n\nSecond, let me check if this provides meaningful, non-tautological information. It says that a picture is a fact. This seems to be making a claim about what a picture is.\n\nThird, is this a definitional statement or a description/observation? Let me consider the reverse: \"A fact is a picture\" - this would not be true, as not all facts are pictures. This asymmetry suggests this is more of a classification or descriptive statement about pictures rather than a definition.\n\nA definition should provide necessary and sufficient conditions. If \"the picture is a fact\" were a definition, then being a fact would be both necessary and sufficient for being a picture. But clearly not all facts are pictures - there are many facts that are not pictures.\n\nThis appears to be a philosophical claim or observation about the nature of pictures (in Wittgenstein's Tractatus context), stating that pictures belong to the category of facts. It's classifying pictures as a type of fact, but it's not defining what a picture is in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions.\n\nThis is more like saying \"A dog is a mammal\" - which classifies dogs but doesn't define them (not all mammals are dogs).\n\nSo this is a descriptive/classificatory statement rather than a definition.\n</thinking_process>\n\nIs a definition: no\nWord defined: none",
