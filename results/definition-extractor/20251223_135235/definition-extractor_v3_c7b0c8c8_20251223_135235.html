Let me analyze this proposition: "The picture depicts reality by representing a possibility of the existence and non-existence of atomic facts."

First, does this have the form "X is Y" or "X means Y"?
The proposition has the form "The picture depicts reality by [method]". This is describing HOW a picture depicts reality, not defining what a picture IS.

This is more of a descriptive statement about the mechanism or method by which pictures depict reality. It tells us something about pictures - specifically how they function - but it doesn't provide a definition of "picture" or any other term.

Let me check if this could be defining "depicts reality" - but even then, it's explaining the mechanism rather than providing necessary and sufficient conditions.

The statement is explaining a property or function of pictures, not defining what a picture is. It's a description of how pictures work, not a definition.

If I try to reverse it: "Representing a possibility of the existence and non-existence of atomic facts is how the picture depicts reality" - this doesn't work as a definition either.

This is a descriptive/explanatory statement about the nature of pictorial representation, not a definition.

Consider the following proposition:

Not how the world is, is the mystical, but that it is.

State if this proposition is a definition.

Your answer must follow this format:
Is a definition: yes|no
Word defined: the word|none
</pre>
        <p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
        <pre><thinking_process>
Let me analyze this proposition: "Not how the world is, is the mystical, but that it is."

First, I need to identify if this has the form "X is Y" or "X means Y".

The proposition seems to be saying something about "the mystical" - specifically that the mystical is not about "how the world is" but rather "that it is" (i.e., the fact of the world's existence).

Let me restructure this: "The mystical is not how the world is, but that it is."

This could be interpreted as: "The mystical = that the world is (exists)" or more precisely "The mystical is the fact that the world exists, not the manner in which it exists."

Now, let me check if this is a definition:
1. Does it have the form "X is Y"? It seems to say "the mystical is that [the world] is" - so there's a form of "X is Y" here.

2. Does Y provide meaningful, non-tautological information about X? Yes, it's saying the mystical is the bare fact of existence, not the particular way things are.

3. Is it definitional rather than descriptive? This is the key question. Is Wittgenstein defining what "the mystical" means, or is he making an observation about what constitutes the mystical?

Let me apply the reversibility test: "That the world is (exists) is the mystical" - does this work as a definition? It seems like it could work both ways.

However, I need to consider whether this is truly a definition providing necessary and sufficient conditions, or whether it's more of a philosophical claim/observation about the nature of the mystical.

Looking at this more carefully, this appears to be a characterization or philosophical claim about what constitutes "the mystical" rather than a formal definition. It's describing what the mystical consists in, but it's more of a philosophical thesis than a definitional statement.

Actually, reconsidering: "The mystical is that the world is" does seem to be stating what the mystical IS - providing an identification. This could be seen as a definition of "the mystical."

But the statement is more nuanced - it's contrasting two things (how vs. that) and making a claim about which one constitutes the mystical. This seems more like a philosophical observation or thesis rather than a straightforward definition.

I'll classify this as not a definition because it's more of a philosophical characterization/claim about what constitutes the mystical rather than a formal definition providing necessary and sufficient conditions.
</thinking_process>

Looking at this proposition: "Not how the world is, is the mystical, but that it is."

Let me analyze its structure:

1. **Form analysis**: This can be restructured as "The mystical is not how the world is, but that it is" - which suggests "The mystical = that the world exists (rather than how it exists)."

2. **Definitional intent check**: This proposition is making a philosophical claim or characterization about what constitutes "the mystical." It contrasts two aspects (the manner of the world's being vs. the fact of its existence) and asserts which one is properly called mystical.

3. **Reversibility test**: "That the world is = the mystical" - this doesn't quite work as a bidirectional definition. The fact of existence isn't exclusively or necessarily "the mystical" in all contexts.

4. **Nature of the statement**: This is a philosophical thesis or observation about what the mystical consists in, rather than a formal definition providing necessary and sufficient conditions. It's descriptive of Wittgenstein's view about the mystical rather than a definitional stipulation of the term's meaning.

The proposition functions more as a philosophical characterization or insight about the nature of the mystical experience, not as a definition that establishes the meaning of the term "mystical."

Let me analyze this proposition: "The applied, thought, propositional sign, is the thought."

First, does it have the form "X is Y"?
Yes, it appears to state that "The applied, thought, propositional sign" is "the thought."

Second, let me check if this provides meaningful, non-tautological information.
The proposition seems to be defining what "the thought" is - it is the applied, thought, propositional sign.

Third, is this a definitional statement?
This appears to be from Wittgenstein's Tractatus. The structure "X is Y" where X = "the applied, thought, propositional sign" and Y = "the thought."

Let me apply the reversibility test: "Y is X" - "The thought is the applied, thought, propositional sign." This seems to hold as well - it's stating an identity/equivalence.

This is providing a definition of what "thought" means in this philosophical context - it is equating "thought" with "the applied, thought, propositional sign."

This matches Example 5 in the examples provided, which states this exact proposition IS a definition with "thought" as the word defined.

So this is a definition of "thought."

Consider the following proposition:

5.523. The generality symbol occurs as an argument.

        <p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
        <pre><thinking_process>
Let me analyze this proposition: "The generality symbol occurs as an argument."

First, I need to identify if this has the form "X is/means Y".

The proposition states that "The generality symbol occurs as an argument." This is describing a behavior or property of the generality symbol - specifically, how it functions or appears (as an argument).

This is not in the form "X is Y" where Y defines what X is. Rather, it's stating something about how X (the generality symbol) behaves or is used.

Let me check the reverse: "An argument is the generality symbol" - this would be false, as arguments can be many things, not just the generality symbol.

This is a descriptive statement about the generality symbol's role or function, not a definition of what the generality symbol is. It tells us something the generality symbol does (occurs as an argument), but doesn't define what the generality symbol is.

A definition would be something like "The generality symbol is X" where X provides necessary and sufficient conditions for being a generality symbol.

This is more of an observation or description about the logical behavior of the generality symbol rather than a definition.

Yes, "everything that is the case" provides substantive content about what "the world" means - it's not saying "the world is the world."

Third, is this a definitional statement rather than a description?
This appears to be a definitional statement. It's stating what the world IS in an essential, defining way. It's the opening proposition of Wittgenstein's Tractatus and functions as a definition of "the world" in his philosophical system.

Fourth, let me apply the reversibility test: "Everything that is the case is the world."
This seems to hold - if we accept that the world is defined as everything that is the case, then everything that is the case would indeed constitute the world. The definition provides necessary and sufficient conditions.

This is a clear definitional statement establishing what "the world" means in this philosophical context. It states that the world = the totality of facts (everything that is the case).

Let me analyze this proposition: "The world is the totality of facts, not of things."

First, does it have the form "X is Y"?
Yes, it states "The world is the totality of facts"

Second, let me check if Y provides meaningful, non-tautological information about X.
"The totality of facts" is not the same as "the world" - it provides substantive information about what the world is.

Third, is this a definitional statement?
This appears to be defining what "the world" means - it's stating that the world IS (equals, is defined as) the totality of facts.

Fourth, let me apply the reversibility test: "The totality of facts is the world"
This seems to hold - if the world is defined as the totality of facts, then the totality of facts would be the world.

However, I need to consider whether this is truly a definition or more of a philosophical claim/thesis. In the context of Wittgenstein's Tractatus (which this is from), this is proposition 1.1, which is presenting a philosophical position about the nature of the world.

But wait - the statement does have the definitional form "X is Y" and provides necessary and sufficient conditions for what "the world" is. It explicitly states what the world IS - the totality of facts (and not things).

Let me reconsider: Is this a stipulative definition or a descriptive/philosophical claim? 

Looking at the structure, it does provide a definition of "the world" - it tells us what the world is constituted by (facts, not things). The phrase "not of things" further clarifies the definition by exclusion.

The reversibility test: "The totality of facts is the world" - this seems to work as well.

This appears to be a genuine definition of "the world" in Wittgenstein's philosophical framework. It states that the world = the totality of facts, providing both necessary and sufficient conditions.

I'll classify this as a definition of "world" (or "the world").

        <p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
        <pre><thinking_process>
Let me analyze the proposition: "The picture is a model of reality."

First, does this have the form "X is Y"?
Yes: "The picture" (X) is "a model of reality" (Y).

Second, does Y provide meaningful, non-tautological information about X?
"A model of reality" does provide some information about what a picture is.

Third, is this a definitional statement or a description/observation?
Let me consider the reverse: "A model of reality is a picture" - is this true? Not necessarily. There could be many models of reality that are not pictures (mathematical models, physical models, mental models, etc.). So the biconditional doesn't hold.

This statement tells us something about pictures - that they function as models of reality - but it doesn't provide necessary and sufficient conditions. It's more of a characterization or description of what pictures do or how they relate to reality, rather than a strict definition.

In the context of Wittgenstein's Tractatus (which this appears to be from), this is describing a property or function of pictures, not defining what "picture" means in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions.

A definition would need to work both ways: if "a picture is a model of reality" were a definition, then anything that is a model of reality would be a picture, which is not the case.

This appears to be a descriptive or characterizing statement about pictures rather than a formal definition.

Let me analyze the proposition "The picture is a fact."

First, does it have the form "X is Y"? Yes, it states "The picture is a fact."

Second, let me check if this provides meaningful, non-tautological information. It says that a picture is a fact. This seems to be making a claim about what a picture is.

Third, is this a definitional statement or a description/observation? Let me consider the reverse: "A fact is a picture" - this would not be true, as not all facts are pictures. This asymmetry suggests this is more of a classification or descriptive statement about pictures rather than a definition.

A definition should provide necessary and sufficient conditions. If "the picture is a fact" were a definition, then being a fact would be both necessary and sufficient for being a picture. But clearly not all facts are pictures - there are many facts that are not pictures.

This statement is more of a classification - it's saying pictures belong to the category of facts, or that pictures have the property of being facts. It's describing a characteristic of pictures rather than defining what a picture is.

In the context of Wittgenstein's Tractatus, this is stating that pictures are facts (composed of elements in relation), but it's not providing a complete definition of what a picture is - it's making a claim about the ontological status of pictures.

This is similar to Example 6 "Space, time and colour (colouredness) are forms of objects" which was classified as not a definition - it's making a categorical statement about what something is, but not providing a full definition.

Therefore, this is not a definition in the strict sense - it's a descriptive/classificatory statement.

Let me analyze this proposition: "Substance is what exists independently of what is the case."

First, I need to identify if this has the form "X is Y":
- X = "Substance"
- Y = "what exists independently of what is the case"

This does have the form "X is Y".

Second, let me check if Y provides meaningful, non-tautological information about X:
- Y tells us that substance is characterized by existing independently of what is the case (i.e., independently of facts or states of affairs)
- This is not a tautology - it provides substantive information about what substance is

Third, let me verify if this is a definitional statement:
- The proposition states what substance IS, providing necessary and sufficient conditions
- It's not merely describing a property of substance, but defining what substance means in this philosophical context

Fourth, let me apply the reversibility test: "What exists independently of what is the case is substance"
- This seems to hold - if something exists independently of what is the case, it would be substance according to this definition
- The definition appears to provide both necessary and sufficient conditions

This appears to be a genuine definition of "substance" in the Tractatus context, stating that substance is defined as that which exists independently of facts/states of affairs.

First, does it have the form "X is Y"?
Yes: "The totality of existent atomic facts" (X) is "the world" (Y).

Third, is it a definitional statement rather than a description?
This appears to be defining "the world" in terms of atomic facts. It's stating what the world IS, not merely describing a property of it.

Fourth, let me check the reversibility: "The world is the totality of existent atomic facts" - does this also hold as true? Yes, this seems to be a biconditional equivalence. The world is defined as exactly the totality of existent atomic facts, and the totality of existent atomic facts constitutes the world.

This is from Wittgenstein's Tractatus, and it does appear to be a definitional statement establishing what "the world" means in his philosophical framework. It provides necessary and sufficient conditions: the world is nothing more and nothing less than the totality of existent atomic facts.

The word being defined here is "world" (or "the world").
