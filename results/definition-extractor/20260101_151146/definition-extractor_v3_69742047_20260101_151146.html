Let me analyze this proposition: "The picture depicts reality by representing a possibility of the existence and non-existence of atomic facts."

First, I need to identify if this has the form "X is Y" or "X means Y".

The proposition states what "the picture" does - it "depicts reality by representing a possibility..." This is describing HOW a picture depicts reality, not defining what a picture IS.

This is more of a descriptive statement about the mechanism or method by which pictures depict reality. It explains the process or manner of depiction rather than providing a definition.

Let me check the reversal test: If we reverse it, would "that which depicts reality by representing a possibility of the existence and non-existence of atomic facts" be equivalent to "the picture"? This seems to describe a function or activity of pictures rather than defining what a picture essentially is.

The statement is explaining what pictures DO (depict reality) and HOW they do it (by representing possibilities), rather than stating what a picture IS in definitional terms.

This appears to be a descriptive or explanatory statement about the nature of pictorial representation, not a formal definition.

Consider the following proposition:

Not how the world is, is the mystical, but that it is.

State if this proposition is a definition.

Your answer must follow this format:
Is a definition: yes|no
Word defined: the word|none
</pre>
        <p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
        <pre><thinking_process>
Let me analyze this proposition: "Not how the world is, is the mystical, but that it is."

First, I need to identify if this has the form "X is Y" or "X means Y".

The proposition seems to be saying something about "the mystical" - specifically that the mystical is not about "how the world is" but rather "that it is" (i.e., the fact of existence itself).

Restructuring: "The mystical is that the world is (exists), not how the world is."

So we have: "The mystical = that the world is (that it exists)"

Let me check the reverse: "That the world is = the mystical" - Does this hold? This seems to be what Wittgenstein is claiming - the sheer fact of existence is what constitutes the mystical.

However, I need to consider whether this is truly a definition or more of a philosophical characterization/description. 

The statement does seem to have definitional form - it's identifying what "the mystical" is. It provides what appears to be a necessary and sufficient condition: the mystical is precisely the fact that the world exists (as opposed to how it exists).

But wait - is this really providing necessary and sufficient conditions in a traditional definitional sense? Or is this more of a philosophical observation/claim about the nature of the mystical?

Looking at the examples:
- "A bachelor is an unmarried man" - clear definition with necessary and sufficient conditions
- "A triangle is a polygon with three sides" - clear definition
- "The applied, thought, propositional sign, is the thought" - marked as definition
- "Space, time and colour are forms of objects" - marked as NOT a definition (descriptive)
- "The law of causality is not a law but the form of a law" - marked as NOT a definition

This proposition seems more like a philosophical characterization of what constitutes "the mystical" rather than a formal definition. It's describing what the mystical consists in, but it's more of a philosophical claim or observation than a strict definition.

Also, the form "that it is" (the bare fact of existence) is quite abstract and doesn't provide the kind of clear, explicit definitional content we see in examples like "bachelor = unmarried man."

I think this is more of a philosophical description/characterization rather than a strict definition. It's telling us something about the mystical, but not in the formal definitional sense.
</thinking_process>

Looking at this proposition: "Not how the world is, is the mystical, but that it is."

Restructured, this says: "The mystical is that the world is (exists), not how the world is."

Let me apply the analysis:

1. **Form check**: This does appear to have the form "X is Y" where X = "the mystical" and Y = "that the world is (exists)"

2. **Reverse check**: "That the world is = the mystical" - This is problematic. The bare fact of existence could be characterized in many ways; it's not clear that every reference to "that the world exists" necessarily refers to "the mystical."

3. **Definitional vs. descriptive**: This proposition is making a philosophical characterization about what constitutes the mystical experience or concept. It's contrasting two aspects (the "how" vs. the "that") and claiming one is mystical. This is more of a philosophical observation or thesis about the nature of the mystical rather than providing necessary and sufficient conditions in a strict definitional sense.

4. **The content "that it is"** is highly abstract and contextual - it doesn't provide the kind of clear, explicit definitional content that would allow someone unfamiliar with the term to understand it completely.

This is a philosophical claim about what the mystical consists in, rather than a formal definition.

Let me analyze this proposition: "The applied, thought, propositional sign, is the thought."

First, does it have the form "X is Y"?
Yes, it states that "The applied, thought, propositional sign" is "the thought."

Second, let me check if this provides meaningful, non-tautological information.
The subject is "the applied, thought, propositional sign" - this appears to be a complex term describing a propositional sign that is applied and thought.
The predicate is "the thought."

This seems to be defining what "the thought" is - it's equating "the thought" with "the applied, thought, propositional sign."

Third, let me verify the reversibility: "Y is X" - "The thought is the applied, thought, propositional sign." This would also be true if this is a genuine definition.

This appears to be from Wittgenstein's Tractatus (proposition 3.5). It's stating that what we call "the thought" is precisely the propositional sign as applied and thought. This provides necessary and sufficient conditions for what constitutes "the thought."

This is a definitional statement - it's telling us what "the thought" is by equating it with another concept. It's not merely describing a property of thought, but defining what thought is.

The word being defined appears to be "thought" (or "the thought").

Let me analyze this proposition: "The generality symbol occurs as an argument."

First, I need to identify if this has the form "X is/means Y".

The proposition states that "The generality symbol occurs as an argument." This is describing a property or behavior of the generality symbol - specifically, how it functions or appears (as an argument).

This is not in the form "X is Y" where Y defines what X is. Rather, it's stating something about how X (the generality symbol) behaves or is used.

Let me check the reverse: "An argument is the generality symbol" - this doesn't hold true, as arguments are not defined as generality symbols.

This is a descriptive statement about the generality symbol's role or function, not a definition of what the generality symbol is. It tells us something the generality symbol does (occurs as an argument), but doesn't define what the generality symbol is.

A definition would be something like "The generality symbol is X" where X provides necessary and sufficient conditions for what makes something a generality symbol.

This is a descriptive/observational statement about the behavior or occurrence of the generality symbol, not a definition.

Yes, "everything that is the case" provides substantive content about what "the world" means - it's defining the world as the totality of facts.

Third, is it a definitional statement rather than a description?
This appears to be a definitional statement - it's stating what the world IS in an essential, defining way.

Fourth, let me apply the reversibility test: "Y is X" - "Everything that is the case is the world."
This seems to hold true in the context of this definition. If the world is defined as everything that is the case, then everything that is the case would indeed constitute the world.

This is the famous opening proposition of Wittgenstein's Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus (proposition 1). It functions as a definition of "the world" - establishing that the world is to be understood as the totality of facts (what is the case), not as a collection of things.

This provides necessary and sufficient conditions: something is part of the world if and only if it is the case.

This appears to be a genuine definition of "the world."

Let me analyze this proposition: "The world is the totality of facts, not of things."

First, does it have the form "X is Y"?
Yes, it states "The world is the totality of facts"

Second, let me check if Y provides meaningful, non-tautological information about X.
"The totality of facts" is not the same as "the world" - it provides substantive information.

Third, is this a definitional statement?
This appears to be defining what "the world" means - it's stating that the world IS (equals, is defined as) the totality of facts.

Fourth, let me apply the reversibility test: "The totality of facts is the world"
This seems to hold - if the world is defined as the totality of facts, then the totality of facts would be the world.

However, I need to consider whether this is truly a definition or more of a philosophical claim/thesis. In the context of Wittgenstein's Tractatus (which this is from), this is presented as a foundational claim about the nature of the world.

The statement "The world is the totality of facts, not of things" does have definitional form. It explicitly states what the world IS - providing what appears to be necessary and sufficient conditions (the totality of facts).

The addition "not of things" reinforces the definitional nature by excluding an alternative characterization.

This does appear to be a definition of "the world" - it's stating that the world is to be understood as/defined as the totality of facts.

Let me reconsider: Is this a description of what the world happens to be, or is it defining what we mean by "the world"?

In philosophical context, this is Wittgenstein defining his use of "the world" for the purposes of the Tractatus. It establishes what "the world" means in his logical-philosophical framework.

I believe this qualifies as a definition of "the world."

        <p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
        <pre><thinking_process>
Let me analyze this proposition: "The picture is a model of reality."

First, does it have the form "X is Y"?
Yes: "The picture" is X, and "a model of reality" is Y.

Second, does Y provide meaningful, non-tautological information about X?
"A model of reality" does provide some information about what a picture is.

Third, is this a definitional statement or a description/observation?
This is tricky. Let me consider the reversibility test: "A model of reality is a picture" - is this true? Not necessarily. There could be many models of reality that are not pictures (mathematical models, physical models, mental models, etc.). So "model of reality" is not a sufficient condition for being a picture.

This statement seems to be describing a property or characteristic of pictures - that they serve as models of reality - rather than providing necessary and sufficient conditions for what constitutes a picture. It's more of a philosophical claim about the nature of pictures rather than a strict definition.

A proper definition would need to provide conditions that are both necessary and sufficient. While being a model of reality might be a necessary feature of pictures (in Wittgenstein's framework), it's not sufficient - not every model of reality is a picture.

This appears to be a descriptive/characterizing statement about pictures rather than a formal definition.

        <pre><thinking_process>
Let me analyze the proposition "The picture is a fact."

First, does it have the form "X is Y"? Yes, it states "The picture is a fact."

Second, let me check if this provides meaningful, non-tautological information. It says that a picture is a fact. This seems to be making a claim about what a picture is.

Third, is this a definitional statement or a description/observation? Let me consider the reverse: "A fact is a picture" - this would not be true, as not all facts are pictures. This asymmetry suggests this is more of a classification or descriptive statement about pictures rather than a definition.

A definition should provide necessary and sufficient conditions. If "the picture is a fact" were a definition, then being a fact would be both necessary and sufficient for being a picture. But clearly not all facts are pictures, so being a fact is not sufficient for being a picture.

This appears to be a philosophical claim or observation about the nature of pictures (in Wittgenstein's technical sense from the Tractatus), stating that pictures belong to the category of facts. It's more of a classification or property attribution than a definition.

Comparing to the examples:
- "A bachelor is an unmarried man" - here "unmarried man" fully defines bachelor (reversible: an unmarried man is a bachelor)
- "A triangle is a polygon with three sides" - here the definition is reversible
- "The applied, thought, propositional sign, is the thought" - this defines "thought"

In contrast, "The picture is a fact" tells us something about pictures (that they are facts) but doesn't define what a picture is in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions. It's a property or classification, not a definition.

Let me analyze this proposition: "Substance is what exists independently of what is the case."

First, I need to identify if this has the form "X is Y":
- X = "Substance"
- Y = "what exists independently of what is the case"

This does have the form "X is Y".

Second, let me check if Y provides meaningful, non-tautological information about X:
- Y tells us that substance is characterized by existing independently of what is the case (i.e., independently of facts or states of affairs)
- This is not a tautology - it provides substantive information about what substance is

Third, let me verify if this is a definitional statement:
- The proposition states what substance IS, providing necessary and sufficient conditions
- It's stating the essential nature of substance

Fourth, let me apply the reversibility test: "What exists independently of what is the case is substance"
- This seems to hold - if something exists independently of what is the case, it would be substance according to this framework
- The definition appears to work in both directions

This appears to be a genuine definition of "substance" in the Tractatus, providing the essential characteristic that defines what substance is.

Let me analyze this proposition: "The totality of existent atomic facts is the world."

First, does it have the form "X is Y"?
Yes: "The totality of existent atomic facts" (X) is "the world" (Y).

Second, does Y provide meaningful, non-tautological information about X?
This states that the world = the totality of existent atomic facts. This is providing a definition of what "the world" is.

Third, is it a definitional statement rather than a description?
This appears to be defining "the world" in terms of atomic facts. It's stating what the world IS, not merely describing a property of it.

Fourth, let me check the reversibility: "The world is the totality of existent atomic facts" - does this also hold as true? Yes, this seems to be a biconditional equivalence. The world is defined as exactly the totality of existent atomic facts, and the totality of existent atomic facts is the world.

This is from Wittgenstein's Tractatus, and it is indeed functioning as a definition of "the world" in his philosophical system. It provides necessary and sufficient conditions: something is the world if and only if it is the totality of existent atomic facts.

The term being defined here is "the world" (or simply "world").
