One day, the woman orders her husband to take her stepdaughter out into the winter wilderness and to leave her there to die, and he obeys, leaving her at the foot of a tree in the forest. Father Frost finds her there, and because the girl is polite and kind to him, he gives her a chest full of beautiful jewels and fine garments. Some time later, the stepmother sends the girl's father to retrieve her body for burial, and is enraged when he instead brings the girl back alive and happy and dressed in finery. Consumed by greed and envy, the woman orders her husband to take her own daughter to the same place, but when found by Father Frost the woman's daughter is rude and unkind to him, and he is inclined to punish rather than reward her. The father finds her frozen to death at the foot of the tree and carries her body back to her grief-stricken mother. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIdentify the narrative functions.\n\nYour answer must contain 2 parts...\nPart 1 is the details table:\n* each line is the candidate function.

Interdiction | 0.20 | No explicit interdiction is given to the hero (stepdaughter). The stepmother's order is to the father, not a prohibition to the girl. |\n| 03.

She warned them against the castle, because an evil witch lived there, but one day the witch saw them and lured them inside. The ducklings slept but the drake stayed awake, and when the witch called if they were asleep, the drake answered. But after two answers, the witch went in to see, and saw the ducklings were asleep, so she killed them.\nThe white duck found the bodies and lamented over them. The king wondered at it, and although the witch tried to persuade him it was nothing but quacking, he ordered that the duck be captured. His servants could not, but he went himself, and she flew to his hands and became a woman. She told of a bottle in the nest in the garden\u2014or, they sent a magpie for magic water\u2014which, sprinkled on the ducklings and drake, turned them into three lovely children.

Mediation | 0.75 | The king \"wondered at\" the duck's lamentation, which makes the misfortune known to him (B\u2074 - misfortune announced), though somewhat indirectly. |\n| 10. Counteraction | 0.70 | The king decides to investigate and orders the duck captured, showing a decision toward counteraction, though not explicitly stated as such. |\n| 11.

Victory | 0.60 | The villain is ultimately defeated, but not through direct combat - rather through exposure and subsequent punishment. |\n| 19.

Unrecognized Arrival | 0.60 | The queen in duck form is unrecognized by the king initially, though this is more a state than an arrival. |\n| 24. Unfounded Claims | 0.90 | The witch presents unfounded claims by taking the queen's form and place, posing as the legitimate queen. |\n| 25. Difficult Task | 0.50 | Capturing the duck proves difficult for servants (they \"could not\"), but this is minor. |\n| 26. Solution | 0.50 | The king himself succeeds in capturing the duck when servants fail. |\n| 27. Recognition | 0.92 | The duck flies to the king's hands and transforms back into a woman - the true queen is recognized. She then tells her story. |\n| 28. Exposure | 0.95 | The queen tells her story, exposing the witch's villainy - \"She told of a bottle in the nest\" and revealed what happened. |\n| 29.

      "input_text": "Consider the following folk tale:\n\"\"\"\nA merchant's wife dies, leaving behind an 8-year-old daughter named Vasilisa. Before her death, the merchant's wife gives Vasilisa a doll with her blessing. This doll is not simple: if it is given something to eat, it can help its owner out of trouble. The merchant eventually remarries to a widow with two daughters the same age as Vasilisa. The new wife dislikes her stepdaughter, giving her various backbreaking jobs, but the doll does all the work for Vasilisa. When Vasilisa grows up, all the suitors in the city begin to woo her. The stepmother refuses everyone, proclaiming that she would not give up her youngest before her elders.\nOne day the merchant leaves home for a long time on business, and during this time, at the stepmother's bidding, the family moves to live in another house, standing near a dense forest, where Baba Yaga's hut is located. The stepmother often sends Vasilisa into the forest, hoping that Baba Yaga will devour her, but Vasilisa's doll always guides her to avoid dangerous paths. Finally, the stepmother and her daughters agree to send Vasilisa directly to Baba Yaga's hut for fire, since during the autumn women's work (weaving, knitting and spinning), which is done at night, all fires excluding a single candle are deliberately extinguished. The doll, as usual, promises to take care of Vasilisa's safety, and she sets off on her journey.\nOn her way she is passed by three horsemen dressed in white, red and black. On Baba Yaga's fence, made of human bones, skulls are hung, the eye sockets of which illuminate the surroundings with their light like lanterns. Baba Yaga rides out of the forest in her flying mortar and heeds Vasilisa's request. Baba Yaga demands that she, under pain of death, first work as a servant. At Baba Yaga's command, the gates open and then lock themselves. Baba Yaga gives Vasilisa various tasks, but she completes everything on time with the doll's help. The colored horsemen pass by the hut, and Vasilisa discovers Baba Yaga's assistants: three pairs of hands that respond and appear at the call of her voice. Baba Yaga explains that the white, red and black horsemen are respectively Day, Sun and Night, but does not explain what the hands are, warning that she dislikes those who air her personal affairs in public, and that she eats those who are too curious.\nEventually, Baba Yaga asks Vasilisa how she managed to accomplish her work so well. When Vasilisa responds that she did so by her mother's blessing, Baba Yaga throws her out of her home, rejecting those who are blessed. However, Baba Yaga gifts Vasilisa a skull with burning eyes to use as a lamp. Vasilisa wants to get rid of it, but the skull warns her against this, asking to be taken to her stepmother's house. There, the light coming from the skull's eye sockets incinerates the stepmother and her two daughters. Vasilisa buries the skull and moves to the city, where she settles with an old clothmaker, deciding to take up spinning and weaving while waiting for her father to return. The fabric in Vasilisa's hands is so thin that the clothmaker can carry it straight to the royal palace. The king asks Vasilisa to sew him blouses from this fabric. Appreciating her skillful work and charmed by her beauty, the king takes Vasilisa as his wife. Her father returns from his trading trip and remains to live at court. Vasilisa also brings the clothmaker into court, and carries the doll in her pocket for the rest of her life.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIdentify the narrative functions.\n\nYour answer must contain 2 parts...\nPart 1 is the details table:\n* each line is the candidate function.

The mother's death at the beginning is also an intensified form of absentation (\u03b2\u00b2). |\n| 02. Interdiction | 0.30 | No explicit interdiction is given to Vasilisa. The mother's blessing and gift of the doll could be seen as implicit guidance, but not a formal interdiction. |\n| 03. Violation of interdiction | 0.20 | Since no clear interdiction is established, there is no clear violation. |\n| 04. Reconnaissance | 0.40 | Baba Yaga asks Vasilisa how she accomplished her work, which could be seen as reconnaissance, but this occurs late in the tale and doesn't fit the canonical position of this function. |\n| 05. Delivery | 0.35 | Vasilisa reveals she accomplished her work \"by her mother's blessing,\" which provides information, but this doesn't lead to villainy\u2014it actually leads to her release. |\n| 06.

Also, there is a lack of fire (\u03b1) which motivates the quest. |\n| 09. Mediation | 0.90 | The lack of fire is made known, and Vasilisa is dispatched to Baba Yaga's hut.

Note: She already possessed the doll from her mother, which is a prior magical agent. |\n| 15. Guidance | 0.70 | The doll guides Vasilisa to avoid dangerous paths, but there's no clear spatial transference to \"another kingdom\" in the classic sense. The journey to Baba Yaga's hut could qualify. |\n| 16. Struggle | 0.25 | There is no direct combat between Vasilisa and a villain. |\n| 17.
