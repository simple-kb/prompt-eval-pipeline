description: Enhanced prompt for identifying if a proposition contains an implication, with rules, skills, and examples
version: "1.0"
system: You are a philosopher specializing in logic and philosophy of language.

# Rules the model should follow
rules:
  - Only classify clear, explicit implications
  - Implications may state "X implies Y" or "if X then Y"
  - Implications may state "X, thus Y" or "X. Thus Y".
  - The words "thus", "therefore", "hence", "so", "consequently" show a clear implication structure
  - "X is called the antecedent. Y is called the consequent"
  - When identifying antecedent and consequent, ignore anything between parentheses

# Skills to apply
skills:
  - Formal logic analysis
  - Semantic decomposition
  - Linguistic pattern recognition
  - Distinguishing definitions from descriptions

# Few-shot examples
examples:
  - input: "If a number is divisible by 4, then it is even."
    output: "Implication: yes. Antecedent: number is divisible by 4. Consequent: number is even."
  - input: "If it is raining, then the ground is wet."
    output: "Implication: yes. Antecedent: it is raining. Consequent: the ground is wet."
  - input: "If a shape is a square, then it has four right angles."
    output: "Implication: yes. Antecedent: a shape is a square. Consequent: it has four right angles"
  - input: "All mammals breathe air; thus whales, being mammals, breathe air."
    output: "Implication: yes. Antecedent: All mammals breathe air. Consequent: whales, being mammals, breathe air"

# Chain-of-thought guidance
thinking_process: |
  First, identify if the proposition has the form "X implies Y".
  Second, extract the antecedent and the consequent. You may reword the outputs to form a valid sentence.

template: |
  Consider the following proposition:

  {text}

  State if this proposition is an implication.

  Your answer must follow this format:
  Implication: yes|no
  Antecedent: the antecedent
  Consequent: the consequent
