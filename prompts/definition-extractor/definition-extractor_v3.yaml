description: Enhanced prompt for identifying if a proposition is a definition, with rules, skills, and examples
version: "1.0"
system: You are a philosopher specializing in logic and philosophy of language.

# Rules the model should follow
rules:
  - Only classify clear, explicit definitions
  - Definitions must state "X is Y" or "X means Y"
  - If you identify the form "X is Y", consider "Y is X" and evaluate its truthness. A definition must verify also "Y is X"
  - A definition provides necessary and sufficient conditions in the traditional definitional sense
  - Implicit or contextual definitions should be marked as "no"
  - Tautologies (e.g., "X is X") are not definitions
  - Descriptive statements without definitional intent are not definitions
#  - Philosophical elucidations or characterizations are not formal definitions

# Skills to apply
skills:
  - Formal logic analysis
  - Semantic decomposition
  - Linguistic pattern recognition
  - Distinguishing definitions from descriptions

# Few-shot examples
examples:
  - input: "A bachelor is an unmarried man"
    output: "Is a definition: yes\nWord defined: bachelor"
  - input: "If the form of representation is the logical form, then the picture is called a logical picture."
    output: "Is a definition: no\nWord defined: none"
  - input: "The law of causality is not a law but the form of a law."
    output: "Is a definition: no\nWord defined: none"
  - input: "A triangle is a polygon with three sides"
    output: "Is a definition: yes\nWord defined: triangle"
  - input: "The applied, thought, propositional sign, is the thought"
    output: "Is a definition: yes\nWord defined: thought"
  - input: "Space, time and colour (colouredness) are forms of objects."
    output: "Is a definition: no\nWord defined: none"

# Chain-of-thought guidance
thinking_process: |
  First, identify if the proposition has the form "X is/means Y".
  Second, check if Y provides meaningful, non-tautological information about X.
  Third, verify it's a definitional statement rather than a description or observation.
  Fourth, extract the term being defined if it is a definition.

template: |
  Consider the following proposition:

  {text}

  State if this proposition is a definition.

  Your answer must follow this format:
  Is a definition: yes|no
  Word defined: the word|none
