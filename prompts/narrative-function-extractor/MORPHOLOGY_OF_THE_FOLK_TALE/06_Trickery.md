**THE VILLAIN ATTEMPTS TO DECEIVE HIS VICTIM IN ORDER TO TAKE POSSESSION OF HIM OR OF HIS BELONGINGS.**

(Definition: trickery. Designation: η)

The villain, first of all, assumes a disguise. A dragon turns into a golden goat (162), or a handsome youth (204); a witch pretends to be a "sweet old lady" (265) and imitates a mother's voice (108); a priest dresses himself in a goat's hide (258); a thief pretends to be a beggarwoman (189). Then follows the function itself.

1. The villain uses persuasion (η¹). A witch tries to have a ring accepted (114); a godmother suggests the taking of a steam bath (187); a witch suggests the removal of clothes (264) and bathing in a pond (265); a beggar seeks alms (189).

2. The villain proceeds to act by the direct application of magical means (η²). The stepmother gives a sleeping potion to her stepson. She sticks a magic pin into his clothing (232).

3. The villain employs other means of deception or coercion (η³). Evil sisters place knives and spikes around a window through which Finist is supposed to fly (234). A dragon rearranges the wood shavings that are to show a young girl the way to her brothers (133).
