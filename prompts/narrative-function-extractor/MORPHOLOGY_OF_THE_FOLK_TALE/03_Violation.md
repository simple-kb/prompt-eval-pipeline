# 03. VIOLATION OF INTERDICTION

Function name: 03. Violation of interdiction

**THE INTERDICTION IS VIOLATED.**

(Definition: violation. Designation: δ)

The forms of violation correspond to the forms of interdiction. Functions II and III form a paired element. The second half can sometimes exist without the first (the tsar's daughters go into the garden [β³]; they are late in returning home). Here the interdiction of tardiness is omitted. A fulfilled order corresponds, as demonstrated, to a violated interdiction.

At this point a new personage, who can be termed the villain, enters the tale. His role is to disturb the peace of a happy family, to cause some form of misfortune, damage, or harm. The villain(s) may be a dragon, a devil, bandits, a witch, or a stepmother, etc. (The question of how new personages, in general, appear in the course of action has been relegated to a special chapter.) Thus, a villain has entered the scene. He has come on foot, sneaked up, or flown down, etc., and begins to act.
