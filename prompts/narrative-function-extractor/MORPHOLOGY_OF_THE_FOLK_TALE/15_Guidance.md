# 15 GUIDANCE

Function name: 15. Guidance

**THE HERO IS TRANSFERRED, DELIVERED, OR LED TO THE WHEREABOUTS OF AN OBJECT OF SEARCH.**

(Definition: spatial transference between two kingdoms, guidance. Designation: G)

Generally the object of search is located in "another" or "different" kingdom. This kingdom may lie far away horizontally, or else very high up or deep down vertically. The means of unification may be identical in all cases, but specific forms do exist for great heights and depths.

1. The hero flies through the air (G¹): on a steed (171); on a bird (219); in the form of a bird (162); on board a flying ship (138); on a flying carpet (192); on the back of a giant or a spirit (212); in the carriage of a devil (154); and so forth. Flight on a bird is sometimes accompanied by a detail: it is necessary to feed the bird on the journey, so the hero brings along an ox, etc.

2. He travels on the ground or on water (G²): on the back of a horse or wolf (168); on board a ship (247); a handless person carries a legless one (198); a cat swims a river on the back of a dog (190).

3. He is led (G³). A ball of thread shows the way (234); a fox leads the hero to the princess (163).

4. The route is shown to him (G⁴). A hedgehog points out the way to a kidnapped brother (113).

5. He makes use of stationary means of communication (G⁵). He climbs a stairway (156); he finds an underground passageway and makes use of it (141); he walks across the back of an enormous pike, as across a bridge (156); he descends by means of leather straps, etc.

6. He follows bloody tracks (G⁶). The hero defeats the inhabitant of a forest hut who runs away, hiding himself under a stone. Following his tracks Iván finds the entrance into another kingdom.

This exhausts the forms of transference of the hero. It should be noted that "delivery," as a function in itself, is sometimes absent: the hero simply walks to the place (i.e., function G amounts to a natural continuation of function ↑). In such a case function G is not singled out.
