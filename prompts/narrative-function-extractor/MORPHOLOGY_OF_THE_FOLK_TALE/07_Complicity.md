# 07 COMPLICITY

Function name: 07. Complicity

**THE VICTIM SUBMITS TO DECEPTION AND THEREBY UNWITTINGLY HELPS HIS ENEMY.**

(Definition: complicity. Designation: θ)

1. The hero agrees to all of the villain's persuasions (i.e., takes the ring, goes to steambathe, to swim, etc.). One notes that interdictions are always broken and, conversely, deceitful proposals are always accepted and fulfilled (θ¹).

2-3. The hero mechanically reacts to the employment of magical or other means (i.e., falls asleep, wounds himself, etc.). It can be observed that this function can also exist separately. No one lulls the hero to sleep: he suddenly falls asleep by himself in order, of course, to facilitate the villain's task (θ²-θ³).

A special form of deceitful proposal and its corresponding acceptance is represented by the deceitful agreement. ("Give away that which you do not know you have in your house.") Assent in these instances is compelled, the villain taking advantage of some difficult situation in which his victim is caught: a scattered flock, extreme poverty, etc. Sometimes the difficult situation is deliberately caused by the villain. (The bear seizes the tsar by the beard [201]). This element may be defined as preliminary misfortune. (Designation: λ, differentiating between this and other forms of deception.)
