# 24 UNFOUNDED CLAIMS

Function name: 24. Unfounded Claims

**A FALSE HERO PRESENTS UNFOUNDED CLAIMS.**

(Definition: unfounded claims. Designation: L)

If the hero arrives home, the false claims are presented by his brothers. If he is serving in another kingdom, a general, a water-carrier, or others present them. The brothers pose as capturers of the prize; the general poses as the conqueror of a dragon. These two forms can be considered special classes.
