# 29 TRANSFIGURATION

Function name: 29. Transfiguration

**THE HERO IS GIVEN A NEW APPEARANCE.**

(Definition: transfiguration. Designation: T)

1. A new appearance is directly effected by means of the magical action of a helper (T¹). The hero passes through the ears of a horse (or cow) and receives a new, handsome appearance.

2. The hero builds a marvelous palace (T²). He resides in the palace himself as the prince. A maiden suddenly awakens during the night in a marvelous palace (127). Although the hero is not always transformed in these instances, he nevertheless does undergo a change in personal appearance.

3. The hero puts on new garments (T³). A girl puts on a (magical?) dress and ornaments and suddenly is endowed with a radiant beauty at which everyone marvels (234).

4. Rationalized and humorous forms (T⁴). These forms are partly explained by those preceding (as their transformations), and, in part, must be studied and explained in connection with the study of tale-anecdotes, whence they originate. Actual changes of appearance do not take place in these cases, but a new appearance is achieved by deception. For example, a fox leads Kuzin'ka to a king saying that Kuzin'ka fell into a ditch and requests clothes. The fox is given royal garments. Kuzin'ka appears in the royal attire and is taken for a tsar's son. All similar instances may be formulated in the following manner: false evidence of wealth and beauty is accepted as true evidence.
