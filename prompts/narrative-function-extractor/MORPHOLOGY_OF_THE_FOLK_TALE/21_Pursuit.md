# 21 PURSUIT

Function name: 21. Pursuit

**THE HERO IS PURSUED.**

(Definition: pursuit, chase. Designation: Pr)

1. The pursuer flies after the hero (Pr¹). A dragon catches up to Iván (160); a witch flies after a boy (105); geese fly after a girl (113).

2. He demands the guilty person (Pr²). This form is also mostly linked with actual flight through the air: The father of a dragon dispatches a flying boat. From the boat they shout, "[we want] the guilty one, the guilty one!" (125).

3. He pursues the hero, rapidly transforming himself into various animals, etc. (Pr³). This form at several stages is also connected with flight: a magician pursues the hero in the forms of a wolf, a pike, a man, and a rooster (249).

4. Pursuers (dragons' wives, etc.) turn into alluring objects and place themselves in the path of the hero (Pr⁴). "I'll run ahead and make the day hot for him, and I shall turn myself into a green meadow. In this green meadow I'll change into a well, and in this well there shall swim a silver goblet . . . here they'll be torn asunder like poppy seeds" (136). She-dragons change into gardens, pillows, wells, etc. The tale does not inform us, however, as to how they manage to get ahead of the hero.

5. The pursuer tries to devour the hero (Pr⁵). A she-dragon turns into a maiden, seduces the hero, and then changes into a lioness that wants to devour Iván (155).

6. The pursuer attempts to kill the hero (Pr⁶). He tries to pound a dead tooth into his head (202).

7. He tries to gnaw through a tree in which the hero is taking refuge (Pr⁷).
