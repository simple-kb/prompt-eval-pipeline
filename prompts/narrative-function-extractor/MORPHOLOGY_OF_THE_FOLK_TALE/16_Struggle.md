# 16 STRUGGLE

Function name: 16. Struggle

**THE HERO AND THE VILLAIN JOIN IN DIRECT COMBAT.**

(Definition: struggle. Designation: H)

This form needs to be distinguished from the struggle (fight) with a hostile donor. These two forms can be distinguished by their results. If the hero obtains an agent, for the purpose of further searching, as the result of an unfriendly encounter, this would be element D. If, on the other hand, the hero receives through victory the very object of his quest, we have situation H.

1. They fight in an open field (H¹). Here, first of all, belong fights with dragons or with Čudo-Judo, etc. (125), and also battles with an enemy army or a knight, etc. (212).

2. They engage in a competition (H²). In humorous tales the fight itself sometimes does not occur. After a squabble (often completely analogous to the squabble that precedes an out-and-out-fight), the hero and the villain engage in a competition. The hero wins with the help of cleverness: a gypsy puts a dragon to flight by squeezing a piece of cheese as though it were a stone, by pretending that a blow to the back of the head was merely a whistle, etc. (149).

3. They play cards (H³). The hero and a dragon (a devil) play cards (192, 153).

4. Tale No. 93 presents a special form: a she-dragon proposes the following to the hero: "Let Prince Iván get on the scales with me; who will outweigh the other?" (H⁴).
