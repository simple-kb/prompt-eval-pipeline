# 11 DEPARTURE

Function name: 11. Departure

**THE HERO LEAVES HOME.**

(Definition: departure. Designation: ↑)

Departure here denotes something different from the temporary absence element, designated earlier by β. The departures of seeker-heroes and victim-heroes are also different. The departures of the former group have search as their goal, while those of the latter mark the beginning of a journey without searches, on which various adventures await the hero. It is necessary to keep the following in mind: if a young girl is abducted and a seeker goes in pursuit of her, then two characters have left home. But the route followed by the story and on which the action is developed is actually the route of the seeker. If, for example, a girl is driven out and there is no seeker, then the narrative is developed along the route of the victim hero. The sign ↑ designates the route of the hero, regardless of whether he is a seeker or not. In certain tales a spatial transference of the hero is absent. The entire action takes place in one location. Sometimes, on the contrary, departure is intensified, assuming the character of flight.

The elements ABC↑ represent the complication. Later on the course of action is developed.

Now a new character enters the tale: this personage might be termed the **donor**, or more precisely, the **provider**. Usually he is encountered accidentally—in the forest, along the roadway, etc. It is from him that the hero (both the seeker hero and the victim hero) obtains some agent (usually magical) which permits the eventual liquidation of misfortune. But before receipt of the magical agent takes place, the hero is subjected to a number of quite diverse actions which, however, all lead to the result that a magical agent comes into his hands.
