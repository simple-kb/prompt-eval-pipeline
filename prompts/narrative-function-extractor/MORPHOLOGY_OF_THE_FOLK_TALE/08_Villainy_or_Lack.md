# 08 VILLAINY (or LACK)

Function name: 08. Villainy (or Lack)

**THE VILLAIN CAUSES HARM OR INJURY TO A MEMBER OF A FAMILY.**

(Definition: villainy. Designation: A)

This function is exceptionally important, since by means of it the actual movement of the tale is created. Absentation, the violation of an interdiction, delivery, the success of a deceit, all prepare the way for this function, create its possibility of occurrence, or simply facilitate its happening. Therefore, the first seven functions may be regarded as the preparatory part of the tale, whereas the complication is begun by an act of villainy. The forms of villainy are exceedingly varied.

1. The villain abducts a person (A¹). A dragon kidnaps the tsar's daughter (131), a peasant's daughter (133); a witch kidnaps a boy (108); older brothers abduct the bride of a younger brother (168).

2. The villain seizes or takes away a magical agent (A²). The "uncomely chap" seizes a magic coffer (189); a princess seizes a magic shirt (208); the finger-sized peasant makes off with a magic steed (138).
   - 2a. The forcible seizure of a magical helper creates a special subclass of this form (Aᵢᵢ). A stepmother orders the killing of a miraculous cow (100, 101). A clerk orders the slaying of a magic duck or chicken (196, 197).

3. The villain pillages or spoils the crops (A³). A mare eats up a haystack (105). A bear steals the oats (143). A crane steals the peas (186).

4. The villain seizes the daylight (A⁴). This occurs only once (135).

5. The villain plunders in other forms (A⁵). The object of seizure fluctuates to an enormous degree, and there is no need to register all of its forms. The object of plunder, as will be apparent later on, does not influence the course of action. Logically, it would generally be more correct to consider all seizure as one form of villainy, and all constituent forms of seizure (subdivided according to their objects) not as classes, but as subclasses. Nevertheless, it is technically more useful to isolate several of its most important forms, and generalize the remainder. Examples: a firebird steals the golden apples (168); a weasel-beast each night eats animals from the tsar's menagerie (132); the general seizes the king's (nonmagical) sword (259); and so forth.

6. The villain causes bodily injury (A⁶). A servant girl cuts out the eyes of her mistress (127). A princess chops off Katoma's legs (198). It is interesting that these forms (from a morphological point of view) are also forms of seizure. The eyes, for example, are placed by the servant girl in a pocket and are carried away; thus they are consequently acquired in the same manner as other seized objects and are put in their proper place. The same is true for a heart that has been cut out.

7. The villain causes a sudden disappearance (A⁷). Usually this disappearance is the result of the application of bewitching or deceitful means; a stepmother puts her stepson into a sleep—his bride disappears forever (232). Sisters place knives and needles in a maiden's window through which Finist is supposed to fly in—he injures his wings and disappears forever (234). A wife flies away from her husband upon a magic carpet (192). Tale No. 267 demonstrates an interesting form. There, disappearance is effected by the hero himself: he burns the (outer) skin of his bewitched wife, and she disappears forever. A special occurrence in tale No. 219 might also conditionally be placed in this class: a bewitched kiss causes a prince to completely forget his bride. In this case the victim is the bride, who loses her betrothed (Aᵛⁱⁱ).

8. The villain demands or entices his victim (A⁸). Usually this form is the result of a deceitful agreement. The king of the sea demands the tsar's son, and he leaves home (219).

9. The villain expels someone (A⁹): A stepmother drives her stepdaughter out (95); a priest expels his grandson (143).

10. The villain orders someone to be thrown into the sea (A¹⁰). A tsar places his daughter and son-in-law in a barrel and orders the barrel to be thrown into the sea (165). Parents launch a small boat, carrying their sleeping son, into the sea (247).

11. The villain casts a spell upon someone or something (A¹¹). At this point one should note that the villain often causes two or three harmful acts at once. There are forms which are rarely encountered independently and which show a propensity for uniting with other forms. The casting of spells belongs to this group. A wife turns her husband into a dog and then drives him out (i.e., A¹¹⁹); a stepmother turns her stepdaughter into a lynx and drives her out (266). Even in instances when a bride is changed into a duck and flies away, we actually have a case of expulsion, although it is not mentioned as such (264, 265).

12. The villain effects a substitution (A¹²). This form also is mostly concomitant. A nursemaid changes a bride into a duckling and substitutes her own daughter in the bride's place (A¹²¹¹; 264). A maid blinds the tsar's bride and poses as the bride (A¹²⁶; 127).

13. The villain orders a murder to be committed (A¹³). This form is in essence a modified (intensified) expulsion: the stepmother orders a servant to kill her stepdaughter while they are out walking (210). A princess orders her servants to take her husband away into the forest and kill him (192). Usually in such instances a presentation of the heart and liver of the victim is demanded.

14. The villain commits murder (A¹⁴). This also is usually only an accompanying form for other acts of villainy, serving to intensify them. A princess seizes her husband's magic shirt and then kills him (i.e., A¹⁴²; 209). Elder brothers kill a younger brother and abduct his bride (i.e., A¹⁴²; 168). A sister takes away her brother's berries and then kills him (244).

15. The villain imprisons or detains someone (A¹⁵). The princess imprisons Iván in a dungeon (185). The king of the sea incarcerates Semën (259).

16. The villain threatens forced matrimony (A¹⁶). A dragon demands the tsar's daughter as his wife (125).
   - 16a. The same form among relatives (Aˣᵛⁱ). A brother demands his sister for a wife (114).

17. The villain makes a threat of cannibalism (A¹⁷). A dragon demands the tsar's daughter for his dinner (171). A dragon has devoured all the people in the village, and the last living peasant is threatened with the same fate (149).
   - 17a. The same form among relatives (Aˣᵛⁱⁱ). A sister intends to devour her brother (93).

18. The villain torments at night (A¹⁸). A dragon (192) or a devil (115) torment a princess at night; a witch flies to a maiden and sucks at her breast (198).

19. The villain declares war (A¹⁹). A neighboring tsar declares war (161); similarly, a dragon ravages kingdoms (137).

## VIIIa. LACK

**ONE MEMBER OF A FAMILY EITHER LACKS SOMETHING OR DESIRES TO HAVE SOMETHING.**

(Definition: lack. Designation: α)

However, far from all tales begin with the affliction of misfortune. There are also other beginnings which often present the same development as tales which begin with (A). On examining this phenomenon, we can observe that these tales proceed from a certain situation of insufficiency or lack, and it is this that leads to quests analogous to those in the case of villainy. We conclude from this that lack can be considered as the morphological equivalent of seizure, for example. Let us consider the following cases: a princess seizes Iván's talisman. The result of this seizure is that Iván lacks the talisman. And so we see that a tale, while omitting villainy, very often begins directly with a lack: Iván desires to have a magic sabre or a magic steed, etc. Insufficiency, just as seizure, determines the next point of the complication: Iván sets out on a quest. The same may be said about the abduction of a bride as about the simple lack of a bride. In the first instance a certain act is given, the result of which creates an insufficiency and provokes a quest; in the second instance a ready-made insufficiency is presented, which also provokes a quest. In the first instance, a lack is created from without; in the second, it is realized from within.

These instances lend themselves to a grouping only with difficulty. It would be possible to break them down according to the forms of the realization of lack; but here it is possible to limit oneself to a distribution according to the objects lacking. It is possible to register the following forms:

1. Lack of a bride (or a friend, or a human being generally). This lack is sometimes depicted quite vividly (the hero intends to search for a bride), and sometimes it is not even mentioned verbally. The hero is unmarried and sets out to find a bride—with this a beginning is given to the course of the action (α¹).

2. A magical agent is needed. For example: apples, water, horses, sabres, etc. (α²).

3. Wondrous objects are lacking (without magical power), such as the firebird, ducks with golden feathers, a wonder-of-wonders, etc. (α³).

4. A specific form: the magic egg containing Koscéj's death (or containing the love of a princess) is lacking (α⁴).

5. Rationalized forms: money, the means of existence, etc. are lacking (α⁵). We note that such beginnings from daily living sometimes develop quite fantastically.

6. Various other forms (α⁶).

Just as the object of seizure does not determine the structure of the tale, neither does the object which is lacking. In consequence, there is no need to systematize all instances for the sake of the general goals of morphology. One can limit oneself to the most important ones and generalize the rest.
