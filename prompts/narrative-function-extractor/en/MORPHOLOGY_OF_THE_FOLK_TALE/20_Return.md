# 20 RETURN

Function number: 20

Function name: 20. Return

**THE HERO RETURNS.**

(Definition: return. Designation: ↓)

A return is generally accomplished by means of the same forms as an arrival. However, there is no need of attaching a special function to follow a return, since returning already implies a surmounting of space. This is not always true in the case of a departure. Following a departure, an agent is given (a horse, eagle, etc.) and then flying or other forms of travel occur, whereas a return takes place immediately and, for the most part, in the same forms as an arrival. Sometimes return has the nature of fleeing.
