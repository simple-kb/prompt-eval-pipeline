**THE VILLAIN MAKES AN ATTEMPT AT RECONNAISSANCE.**

(Definition: reconnaissance. Designation: ε)

1. The reconnaissance has the aim of finding out the location of children, or sometimes of precious objects, etc. (ε¹). A bear says: "Who will tell me what has become of the tsar's children? Where did they disappear to?" (201); a clerk: "Where do you get these precious stones?" (197); a priest at confession: "How were you able to get well so quickly?" (258); a princess: "Tell me, Iván the merchant's son, where is your wisdom?" (209); "What does the bitch live on?" Jágišna thinks. She sends One-Eye, Two-Eye and Three-Eye on reconnaissance (101).

2. An inverted form of reconnaissance is evidenced when the intended victim questions the villain (ε²). "Where is your death, Koscéj?" (156). "What a swift steed you have! Could one get another one somewhere that could outrun yours?" (160).

3. In separate instances one encounters forms of reconnaissance by means of other personages (ε³).
