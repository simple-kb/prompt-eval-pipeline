Function number: 05

Function name: 05. Delivery

**THE VILLAIN RECEIVES INFORMATION ABOUT HIS VICTIM.**

(Definition: delivery. Designation: ζ)

1. The villain directly receives an answer to his question. (ζ¹) The chisel answers the bear: "Take me out into the courtyard and throw me to the ground; where I stick, there's the hive." To the clerk's question about the precious stones, the merchant's wife replies: "Oh, the hen lays them for us," etc. Once again we are confronted with paired functions. They often occur in the form of a dialogue. Here, incidentally, also belongs the dialogue between the stepmother and the mirror. Although the stepmother does not directly ask about her stepdaughter, the mirror answers her: "There is no doubt of your beauty; but you have a stepdaughter, living with knights in the deep forest, and she is even more beautiful." As in other similar instances, the second half of the paired function can exist without the first. In these cases the delivery takes the form of a careless act: A mother calls her son home in a loud voice and thereby betrays his presence to a witch (108). An old man has received a marvelous bag; he gives the godmother a treat from the bag and thereby gives away the secret of his talisman to her (187).

2-3. An inverted or other form of information-gathering evokes a corresponding answer. (ζ²-ζ³) Koscéj reveals the secret of his death (156), the secret of the swift steed (159), and so forth.
