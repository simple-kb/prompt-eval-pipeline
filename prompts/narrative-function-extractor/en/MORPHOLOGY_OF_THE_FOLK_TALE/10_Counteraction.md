# 10 COUNTERACTION

Function number: 10

Function name: 10. Counteraction

**THE SEEKER AGREES TO OR DECIDES UPON COUNTERACTION.**

(Definition: beginning counteraction. Designation: C)

This moment is characterized in such words, for instance, as the following: "Permit us to go in search of your princess", etc. Sometimes this moment is not expressed in words, but a volitional decision, of course, precedes the search. This moment is characteristic only of those tales in which the hero is a seeker. Banished, vanquished, bewitched, and substituted heroes demonstrate no volitional aspiration toward freedom, and in such cases this element is lacking.
