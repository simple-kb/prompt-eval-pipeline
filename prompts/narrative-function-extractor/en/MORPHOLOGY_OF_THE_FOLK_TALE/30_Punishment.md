# 30 THE VILLAIN IS PUNISHED

Function number: 30

Function name: 30. The Villain is Punished

**Definition:** punishment

**Designation:** U

## Description

The villain is shot, banished, tied to the tail of a horse, commits suicide, and so forth. In parallel with this we sometimes have a magnanimous pardon (U neg.).

Usually only the villain of the second move and the false hero are punished, while the first villain is punished only in those cases in which a battle and pursuit are absent from the story. Otherwise, he is killed in battle or perishes during the pursuit (a witch bursts in an attempt to drink up the sea, etc.).
