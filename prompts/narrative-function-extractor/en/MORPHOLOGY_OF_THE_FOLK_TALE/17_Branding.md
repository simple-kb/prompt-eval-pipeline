**THE HERO IS BRANDED.**

(Definition: branding, marking. Designation: J)

1. A brand is applied to the body (J¹). The hero receives a wound during the skirmish. A princess awakens him before the fight by making a small wound in his cheek with a knife (125). A princess brands the hero on the forehead with a signet ring (195); she kisses him, leaving a burning star on his forehead.

2. The hero receives a ring or a towel (J²). We have a combination of two forms if the hero is wounded in battle and the wound is bound with the kerchief of either a princess or a king.
