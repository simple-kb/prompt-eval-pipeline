# 28 EXPOSURE

Function number: 28

Function name: 28. Exposure

**THE FALSE HERO OR VILLAIN IS EXPOSED.**

(Definition: exposure. Designation: Ex)

This function is, in most cases, connected with the one preceding. Sometimes it is the result of an uncompleted task (the false hero cannot lift the dragon's heads). Most often it is presented in the form of a story ("Here the princess told everything as it was"). Sometimes all the events are recounted from the very beginning in the form of a tale. The villain is among the listeners, and he gives himself away by expressions of disapproval (197). Sometimes a song is sung telling of what has occurred and exposing the villain (244). Other unique forms of exposure also occur (258).
