# 13 HERO'S REACTION

Function number: 13

Function name: 13. Hero's Reaction

**THE HERO REACTS TO THE ACTIONS OF THE FUTURE DONOR.**

(Definition: the hero's reaction. Designation: E)

In the majority of instances, the reaction is either positive or negative.

1. The hero withstands (or does not withstand) a test (E¹).

2. The hero answers (or does not answer) a greeting (E²).

3. He renders (or does not render) a service to a dead person (E³).

4. He frees a captive (E⁴).

5. He shows mercy to a suppliant (E⁵).

6. He completes an apportionment and reconciles the disputants (E⁶). The request of disputants (or simply an argument without a request) more often evokes a different reaction. The hero deceives the disputants, making them run, for example, after an arrow which he has shot into the distance; meanwhile, he himself seizes the disputed objects (Eᵛⁱ).

7. The hero performs some other service (E⁷). Sometimes these services correspond to requests; other times, they are done purely through the kindheartedness of the hero. A young girl feeds passing beggars (114). A special subclass might be made by forms of a religious nature. A hero burns a barrel of frankincense to the glory of God. To this group one instance of a prayer might also be relegated (115).

8. The hero saves himself from an attempt on his life by employing the same tactics used by his adversary (E⁸). He puts the witch into the stove by making her show how to climb in (108). The heroes exchange clothes with the daughters of the witch in secret; she proceeds to kill them instead of the heroes (105). The magician himself remains on the mountain where he wanted to abandon the hero (243).

9. The hero vanquishes (or does not vanquish) his adversary (E⁹).

10. The hero agrees to an exchange, but immediately employs the magic power of the object exchanged against the barterer (E¹⁰). An old man offers to trade his magic sword to a cossack for a magic cask. The cossack makes the exchange, whereupon he orders the sword to cut off the old man's head, thus getting back the cask also (270).
