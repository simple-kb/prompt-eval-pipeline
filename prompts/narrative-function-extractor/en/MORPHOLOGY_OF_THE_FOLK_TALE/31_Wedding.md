# 31 THE HERO IS MARRIED AND ASCENDS THE THRONE

Function number: 31

Function name: 31. The Hero is Married and Ascends the Throne

**Definition:** wedding

**Designation:** W

## Description

### Forms of Wedding/Reward

1. **A bride and a kingdom are awarded at once** (W**), or the hero receives half the kingdom at first, and the whole kingdom upon the death of the parents.

2. **Sometimes the hero simply marries without obtaining a throne** (W*), since his bride is not a princess.

3. **Sometimes, on the contrary, only accession to the throne is mentioned** (W*).

4. **If a new act of villainy interrupts a tale shortly before a wedding**, then the first move ends with a betrothal, or a promise of marriage (w1).

5. **In contrast to the preceding case, a married hero loses his wife**; the marriage is resumed as the result of a quest (designation for a resumed marriage: w2).

6. **The hero sometimes receives a monetary reward or some other form of compensation** in place of the princess' hand (wo).

At this point the tale draws to a close. It should also be stated that there are several actions of tale heroes in individual cases which do not conform to, nor are defined by, any of the functions already mentioned. Such cases are rare. They are either forms which cannot be understood without comparative material, or they are forms transferred from tales of other classes (anecdotes, legends, etc.). We define these as unclear elements and designate them with the sign X.
