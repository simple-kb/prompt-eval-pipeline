**THE HERO IS RECOGNIZED.**

(Definition: recognition. Designation: Q)

He is recognized by a mark, a brand (a wound, a star marking), or by a thing given to him (a ring, towel). In this case, recognition serves as a function corresponding to branding and marking. The hero is also recognized by his accomplishment of a difficult task (this is almost always preceded by an unrecognized arrival). Finally, the hero may be recognized immediately after a long period of separation. In the latter case, parents and children, brothers and sisters, etc., may recognize one another.
