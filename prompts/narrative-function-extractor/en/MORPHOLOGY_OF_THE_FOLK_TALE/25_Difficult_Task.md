# 25 DIFFICULT TASK

Function number: 25

Function name: 25. Difficult Task

**A DIFFICULT TASK IS PROPOSED TO THE HERO.**

(Definition: difficult task. Designation: M)

This is one of the tale's favorite elements. Tasks are also assigned outside the connections just described, but these connections will be dealt with somewhat later. At the moment, let us take up the matter of the tasks per se. These tasks are so varied that each would need a special designation. However, there is no need at present to go into these details. Since no exact distribution will be made, we shall enumerate all instances present in our material, with an approximate arrangement into groups:

**Ordeal by food and drink:** to eat a certain number of oxen or wagonloads of bread; to drink a great deal of beer (137, 138, 144).

**Ordeal by fire:** to bathe in a red-hot iron bathhouse. This form is always connected with the previous ordeal (137, 138, 144). A separate form: a bath in boiling water (169).

**Riddle guessing and similar ordeals:** to pose an unsolvable riddle (239); to recount and interpret a dream (241); to explain the meaning of the ravens' croaking at the tsar's window, and to drive them away (247); to find out (to guess) the distinctive marks of a tsar's daughter (238).

**Ordeal of choice:** to select sought-after persons among twelve identical girls (or boys) (219, 227, 249).

**Hide and seek:** to hide oneself so that discovery is impossible (236).

**To kiss the princess in a window** (180, 182).

**To jump up on top of the gates** (101).

**Test of strength, adroitness, fortitude:** a princess chokes Iván at night or squeezes his hand (198, 136); the task of picking up the heads of a decapitated dragon (171), of breaking in a horse (198), of milking a herd of wild mares (170), of defeating an amazon (202), or a rival (167), is given to the hero.

**Test of endurance:** to spend seven years in the tin kingdom (270).

**Tasks of supply and manufacture:** to supply a medicine (123); to obtain a wedding dress, a ring, shoes (132, 139, 156, 169); to deliver the hair of the king of the sea (240); to deliver a flying boat (144); to deliver life-giving water (144); to supply a troop of soldiers (144); to obtain seventy-seven mares (170); to build a palace during one night (190), a bridge leading to it (216); to bring "the mate to my unknown one to make a pair" (240).

**As tasks of manufacture:** to sew shirts (104, 267); to bake bread (267); as the third task in this case, the tsar asks who dances better.

**Other tasks:** to pick berries from a certain bush or tree (100, 101); to cross a pit on a pole (137); to find someone "whose candle will light by itself" (195).

The method of differentiation of these tasks from other highly similar elements will be outlined in the chapter on assimilations.
