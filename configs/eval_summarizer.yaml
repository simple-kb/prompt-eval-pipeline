# Test cases for evaluation
test_cases:
  - name: simple_facts
    inputs:
      text: "Python is a popular programming language created by Guido van Rossum. It was first released in 1991. Python is known for its simple, readable syntax."
      max_sentences: 2
    expected_contains:
      - "Python"
      - "programming"
    tags:
      - basic

  - name: complex_topic
    inputs:
      text: "Quantum computing leverages quantum mechanical phenomena like superposition and entanglement to process information. Unlike classical computers that use bits (0 or 1), quantum computers use qubits that can exist in multiple states simultaneously. This allows them to solve certain problems exponentially faster than traditional computers."
