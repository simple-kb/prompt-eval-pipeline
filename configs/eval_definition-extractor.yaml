# Metrics to evaluate
metrics:
  - type: contains
    case_sensitive: false
  
  # Uncomment to add LLM-based evaluation (uses more API calls)
  # - type: llm_judge
  #   criteria: |
  #     Evaluate the summary on:
  #     1. Accuracy - Does it capture the main points?
  #     2. Conciseness - Is it appropriately brief?
  #     3. Clarity - Is it easy to understand?
